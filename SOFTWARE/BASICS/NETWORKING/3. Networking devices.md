### NIC
-  NIC stands for network interface card.
- NIC is a hardware component used to connect a computer with another computer onto a network
- It can support a transfer rate of 10,100 to 1000 Mb/s.
- The MAC address or physical address is encoded on the network card chip which is assigned by the IEEE to identify a network card uniquely. The MAC address is stored in the PROM (Programmable read-only memory).
- **There are two types of NIC:**
	- 1. Wired NIC : The Wired NIC is present inside the motherboard. Cables and connectors are used with wired NIC to transfer data.
	- 2. Wireless NIC: The wireless NIC contains the antenna to obtain the connection over the wireless network. For example, laptop computer contains the wireless NIC.

### Repeater
- Used to generate incoming electrical, wireless or optical signals
- Data are carried in the form of signals over the cable. These signals can travel a specified distance (usually about 100 m). Signals lose their strength beyond this limit and become weak. In such conditions, original signals need to be regenerated.
- A repeater is an analog device that works with signals on the cables to which it is connected. The weakened signal appearing on the cable is regenerated and put back on the cable by a repeater.

### HUB
- An Ethernet hub is a network device used to connect different devices through wires. Data arriving on any of the lines are sent out on all the others. The limitation of Hub is that if data from two devices come at the same time, they will collide.
-  It is a small network device. It joins multiple computers together to form a single network segment. On this segment, all computers can interact with each other.
- half-duplex

### Switch
- A switch is more advanced and connects multiple devices within a network, forwarding data only to the specific device that needs it. It uses MAC addresses to identify connected devices.
- A switch is a networking device (Figure 10.12) that plays a central role in a Local Area Network (LAN). Like a hub, a network switch is used to connect multiple computers or communicating devices.When data arrives, the switch extracts the destination address from the data packet and looks it up in a table to see where to send the packet. Thus, it sends signals to only selected devices instead of sending to all.
- It Operates at the **data link layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model. Some advanced switches also work at **Layer 3 (network layer)** and can perform routing functions.
- It can forward multiple packets at the same time.
- full-duplex
