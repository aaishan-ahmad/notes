### Data communication
- The term “Data Communication” comprises two words: Data and Communication.
- Data can be any text, image, audio, video, and multimedia files. Communication is an act of sending or receiving data.Thus, data communication refers to the exchange of data between two or more networked or connected devices. These devices must be capable of sending and receiving data over a communication medium.

### Components of data communication
- Whenever we talk about communication between two computing devices using a network, five most important aspects come to our mind. These are sender, receiver, communication medium, the message to be communicated, and certain rules called protocols to be followed during communication.
- **Sender** : A sender is a computer or any such device which is capable of sending data over a network. It can be a computer, mobile phone, smartwatch, walkie-talkie, video recording device, etc.
- **Receiver** : A receiver is a computer or any such device which is capable of receiving data from the network. It can be any computer, printer, laptop, mobile phone, television, etc. In computer communication, the sender and receiver are known as nodes in a network.
- **Message** : It is the data or information that needs to be exchanged between the sender and the receiver. Messages can be in the form of text, number, image, audio, video, multimedia, etc.
- **Communication media** : It is the path through which the message travels between source and destination. It is also called medium or link which is either wired or wireless. For example, a television cable, telephone cable, ethernet cable, satellite link, microwaves, etc.
- **Protocols** : It is a set of rules that need to be followed by the communicating parties in order to have successful and reliable data communication. You have already come across protocols such as Ethernet and HTTP.

### Measuring Capacity of Communication Media
- In data communication, the transmission medium is also known as channel. The capacity of a channel is the maximum amount of signals or traffic that a channel can carry. It is measured in terms of bandwidth and data transfer rate
- **Bandwidth** : Bandwidth of a channel is the range of frequencies available for transmission of data through that channel. Higher the bandwidth, higher the data transfer rate. Normally, bandwidth is the difference of maximum and minimum frequency contained in the composite signals. Bandwidth is measured in Hertz (Hz). 1 KHz =1000 Hz 1 MHz =1000 KHz = 1000000 Hz
- **Data Transfer Rate** : Data travels in the form of signals over a channel. One signal carries one or more bits over the channel. Data transfer rate is the number of bits transmitted between source and destination in one second. It is also known as bit rate. It is measured in terms of bits per second (bps). The higher units for data transfer rates are: 1 Kbps=2<sup>10</sup> bps=1024 bps,                             1Mbps=2<sup>20</sup>bps=1024 Kbps, 1 Gbps=2<sup>30</sup> bps=1024 Mbps, 1 Tbps=2<sup>40</sup> bps=1024 Gbps.

### Transmisiion Modes / Communication Modes 
- The way in which data is transmitted from one device to another device is known as transmission mode. Aka communication mode.
- Each communication channel has a direction associated with it, and transmission media provide the direction. Therefore, the transmission mode is also known as a directional mode.
-  The transmission mode is defined in the physical layer.
- The Transmission mode is divided into three categories: (types of data communication)
	- Simplex mode
	- Half-duplex mode
	- Full-duplex mode

### Simplex Mode
- In Simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, i.e., the data flow in one direction.
- A device can only send the data but cannot receive it or it can receive the data but cannot send the data.
- This transmission mode is not very popular as mainly communications require the two-way exchange of data. The simplex mode is used in the business field as in sales that do not require any corresponding reply.
- The radio station is a simplex channel as it transmits the signal to the listeners but never allows them to transmit back.
- Keyboard and Monitor are the examples of the simplex mode as a keyboard can only accept the data from the user and monitor can only be used to display the data on the screen.
- The main advantage of the simplex mode is that the full capacity of the communication channel can be utilized during transmission.

### Half-duplex Mode
-  In a Half-duplex channel, direction can be reversed, i.e., the station can transmit and receive the data as well.
- Messages flow in both the directions, but not at the same time.
- The entire bandwidth of the communication channel is utilized in one direction at a time.
- In half-duplex mode, it is possible to perform the error detection, and if any error occurs, then the receiver requests the sender to retransmit the data.
- A **Walkie-talkie** is an example of the Half-duplex mode. In Walkie-talkie, one party speaks, and another party listens. After a pause, the other speaks and first party listens. Speaking simultaneously will create the distorted sound which cannot be understood.

### Full Duplex Mode
- In Full duplex mode, the communication is bi-directional, i.e., the data flow in both the directions.
- Both the stations can send and receive the message simultaneously.
- Full-duplex mode has two simplex channels. One channel has traffic moving in one direction, and another channel has traffic flowing in the opposite direction.
- The Full-duplex mode is the fastest mode of communication between devices.
- The most common example of the full-duplex mode is a telephone network. When two people are communicating with each other by a telephone line, both can talk and listen at the same time.
