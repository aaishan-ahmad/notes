### Topology
- Topology refers to physical layout including computers, cables, and other resources; it determines how components communicate with each other.
- Todayâ€™s network designs are based on three topologies: 
	- Bus consists of series of computers connected along a single cable segment 
	- Star connects computers via central connection point or hub 
	- Ring connects computers to form a loop
- All computers, regardless of topology, communicate by addressing data to one or more computers and transmitting it across cable as electronic signals. Data is broken into packets and sent as electronic signals that travel on the cable. Only the computer to which the data is addressed accepts it.

### Protocol 
- Protocols mean set of rules. It is a formal description of message formats and the rules two or more machines has follow to exchange messages. The key elements of a protocol are syntax, semantics and timing. 
- **Syntax** : Syntax refers to the structure or format of the data, meaning the order in which they arepresented. 
- **Semantics** :Semantics refers to the meaning of each section of bits. 
- **Timing** : Timing refers to when data should be sent and how fast it can be sent.
