### Topology
- Topology refers to physical layout including computers, cables, and other resources.
- It refers to the arrangement or layout of various elements (links, nodes, etc.) in a network. This structure determines how the devices are interconnected and how data flows between them.
- All computers, regardless of topology, communicate by addressing data to one or more computers and transmitting it across cable as electronic signals. Data is broken into packets and sent as electronic signals that travel on the cable. Only the computer to which the data is addressed accepts it.
- Today’s network designs are based on three topologies: 
	- Bus consists of series of computers connected along a single cable segment 
	- Star connects computers via central connection point or hub 
	- Ring connects computers to form a loop

- Types of topology
	- Bus topology
	- Ring topology
	- Star topology
	- Tree topology
	- Mesh topology 
	- Hybrid topology 
	

### Bus topology 
-  The bus topology is designed in such a way that all the stations are connected through a single cable known as a backbone cable.
- Each node is either connected to the backbone cable by drop cable or directly connected to the backbone cable.
- When a node wants to send a message over the network, it puts a message over the network. All the stations available in the network will receive the message whether it has been addressed or not.
- The bus topology is mainly used in 802.3 (ethernet) and 802.4 standard networks.
- The configuration of a bus topology is quite simpler as compared to other topologies.
- The backbone cable is considered as a "single lane" through which the message is broadcast to all the stations.
- The most common access method of the bus topologies is **CSMA** (Carrier Sense Multiple Access).

- **CSMA:** It is a media access control used to control the data flow so that data integrity is maintained, i.e., the packets do not get lost. There are two alternative ways of handling the problems that occur when two nodes send the messages simultaneously.
	- **CSMA CD:** CSMA CD (**Collision detection**) is an access method used to detect the collision. Once the collision is detected, the sender will stop transmitting the data. Therefore, it works on "**recovery after the collision**".
    - **CSMA CA:** **CSMA CA (Collision Avoidance)** is an access method used to avoid the collision by checking whether the transmission media is busy or not. If busy, then the sender waits until the media becomes idle. This technique effectively reduces the possibility of the collision. It does not work on "recovery after the collision". 

### Ring topology
- Ring topology is like a bus topology, but with connected ends.
- The node that receives the message from the previous computer will retransmit to the next node.
- The data flows in one direction(clockwise or counterclockwise), i.e., it is unidirectional.
- The data flows in a single loop continuously known as an endless loop.
- It has no terminated ends, i.e., each node is connected to other node and having no termination point.
- The data in a ring topology flow in a clockwise direction.
- The most common access method of the ring topology is **token passing**.
    - **Token passing:** It is a network access method in which token is passed from one node to another node.
    - **Token:** It is a frame that circulates around the network.

### Star topology
-  Star topology is an arrangement of the network in which every node is connected to the central nodes (hub, switch or a central computer).
- Coaxial cable or RJ-45 cables are used to connect the computers.
- Hubs or Switches are mainly used as connection devices in star topology.
-  Star topology is the most popular topology in network implementation.
- Star topology is considered very effective, efficient and fast as each device is directly connected with the central device. Although disturbance in one device will not affect the rest of the network, any failure in a central networking device may lead to the failure of complete network.

### Tree/hierarchy topology 
- It is a hierarchical topology, in which there are multiple branches and each branch can have one or more basic topologies like star, ring and bus.
- Such topologies are usually realised in WANs where multiple LANs are connected. Those LANs may be in the form of a ring, bus or star.  
- In this type of network, data transmitted from source first reaches the centralised device and from there the data passes through every branch where each branch can have links for more nodes.

### Mesh topology
- In this networking topology, each communicating device is connected with every other device in the network.
-  Such a network can handle large amounts of traffic since multiple nodes can transmit data simultaneously. Also, such networks are more reliable in the sense that even if a node gets down, it does not cause any break in the transmission of data between other nodes.
- This topology is also more secure as compared to other topologies because each cable between two nodes carries different data. However,Expensive and complex to set up due to the large number of connections needed.

### Hybrid topology 
- The combination of various different topologies is known as Hybrid topology.
- When two or more different topologies are combined together is termed as Hybrid topology and if similar topologies are connected with each other will not result in Hybrid topology.
- A Hybrid topology is a connection between different links and nodes to transfer the data.

### Protocols
- Protocols mean set of rules. It is a formal description of message formats and the rules two or more machines has follow to exchange messages. The key elements of a protocol are syntax, semantics and timing. 
- **Syntax** : Syntax refers to the structure or format of the data, meaning the order in which they arepresented. 
- **Semantics** :Semantics refers to the meaning of each section of bits. 
- **Timing** : Timing refers to when data should be sent and how fast it can be sent.
