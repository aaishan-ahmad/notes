###  **Memory**
- Device to store content in computer system
- We don't use single memory in computer , instead we use a memory hierarchy 
---

### **Memory Hierarchy**
- Memory hierarchy is used when discussing performance  issues.
- Goal of memory Hierarchy
	- 1. To maximize the access speed
	- 2. To minimize the per bit storage

### **Memory Representation**
- **Memory represented as** : no of cells X 1 cell capacity 
![[Pasted image 20250128191124.png]]
- each cell is uniquly identify by numbering = memory address

- So no of cell X 1 cell capacity = no of memory location X bits per locations

- Memory 
	- 1. Byte addressable(currently used) : 1 cell = 1 byte = 8 bit 
	- 2. word addresable : 1 cell  = 1 word = 4 bytes (generally)

- **Memory Cycle Time :** Time required to perform read or write on one cell in memory.

### **Main Memory : RAM & ROM**
- Main memory aka Primary memory 
- Used to store current running programs(instructions) and their data 
- Types 
	- RAM ( Random Access Memory ) : Volatile , random access 
	- ROM ( Read Only Memory ) : Non-volatile , readonly , random access
- **ROM  work**
	- 1. p.o.s .t (Power on self test ) : POST is a process performed by firmware or software routines (stored in rom) immediately after a computer or other digital electronic device is powered.
	- 2. booting : load os on ram (form secondary memory) , program name bootsrap (stored in rom)  
	- 3. rom work end and ram start working 
- **RAM work**
	- rom load os then rom work done and ram start work
	- ram keep os and load program that we want execute done by os
- **Types of RAM : based on how ram designed**
	- 1. Static RAM :
	- 2. Dynamic RAM
