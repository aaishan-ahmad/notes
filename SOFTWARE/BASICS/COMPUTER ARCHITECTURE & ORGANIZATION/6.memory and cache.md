###  **Memory**
- Device to store content in computer system
- We don't use single memory in computer , instead we use a memory hierarchy 
---

### **Memory Hierarchy**
- Memory hierarchy is used when discussing performance  issues.
- Goal of memory Hierarchy
	- 1. To maximize the access speed
	- 2. To minimize the per bit storage

### **Memory Representation**
- **Memory represented as** : no of cells X 1 cell capacity 
![[Pasted image 20250128191124.png]]
- each cell is uniquly identify by numbering = memory address
![[Pasted image 20250128191356.png]]
- So no of cell X 1 cell capacity = no of memory location X bits per locations

- **Memory** 
	- **1. Byte addressable(currently used) :** 1 cell = 1 byte = 8 bit 
	- **2. word addresable :** 1 cell  = 1 word = 4 bytes (generally)

- **Memory Cycle Time :** Time required to perform read or write on one cell in memory.

### **Main Memory : RAM & ROM**
- Main memory aka Primary memory 
- Used to store current running programs(instructions) and their data 
- Types 
	- RAM ( Random Access Memory ) : Volatile , random access 
	- ROM ( Read Only Memory ) : Non-volatile , readonly , random access
- **ROM  work**
	- 1. p.o.s .t (Power on self test ) : POST is a process performed by firmware or software routines (stored in rom) immediately after a computer or other digital electronic device is powered. it check devices connected with computer.
	- 2. booting : load os on ram (form secondary memory) , program name bootsrap (stored in rom)  
	- 3. rom work end and ram start working ![[Pasted image 20250129105709.png]]
- **RAM work**
	- rom load os then rom work done and ram start work
	- ram keep os and load program ( with help of  os) that we want execute
- **Types of RAM : based on how ram designed**
	- 1. Static RAM (SRAM) :
		- Made of -> flip-flop
		- No refresh required
		- fast
		- expensive
		- used for cache
	- 2. Dynamic RAM  (DRAM) :
		- Made of -> capacitor (storage in form of electric charges)
		- Periodic refresh is required to keep the content . (because after some time changes , discharge)
		- slower (due to refresh)
		- less expensive
		- used from main memory implementation ![[Pasted image 20250129101132.png]]

### **Memory Cell Access**
- we use decoder

### **Multiple Chips  in Single System**
### 1. vertical arrangements 
- Used when no of addresses required in memory system is more then in single chip
![[Pasted image 20250129151059.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250129185725.png]]

### 2. Horizontal Arrangement  
- Used when data per location  is required more than one chip data
![[Pasted image 20250129185923.png]]

### 3. Hybrid Arrangment
- Used when data per location and no of addresses both required more then a single chip
