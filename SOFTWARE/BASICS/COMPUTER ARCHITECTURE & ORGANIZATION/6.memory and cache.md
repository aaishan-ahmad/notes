 ###  **Memory**
- Device to store content in computer system
- We don't use single memory in computer , instead we use a memory hierarchy 
---

### **Memory Hierarchy**
- Memory hierarchy is used when discussing performance  issues.
- Goal of memory Hierarchy
	- 1. To maximize the access speed
	- 2. To minimize the per bit storage

### **Memory Representation**
- **Memory represented as** : no of cells X 1 cell capacity 
![[Pasted image 20250128191124.png]]
- each cell is uniquly identify by numbering = memory address
![[Pasted image 20250128191356.png]]
- So no of cell X 1 cell capacity = no of memory location X bits per locations
![[Pasted image 20250128192449.png]]
- **Memory** 
	- **1. Byte addressable(currently used) :** 1 cell = 1 byte = 8 bit 
	- **2. word addresable :** 1 cell  = 1 word = 4 bytes (generally)
![[Pasted image 20250128193852.png]]
- **Memory Cycle Time :** Time required to perform read or write on one cell in memory.

### **Main Memory : RAM & ROM**
- Main memory aka Primary memory 
- Used to store current running programs(instructions) and their data 
- Types 
	- RAM ( Random Access Memory ) : Volatile , random access 
	- ROM ( Read Only Memory ) : Non-volatile , readonly , random access
- **ROM  work**
	- 1. p.o.s .t (Power on self test ) : POST is a process performed by firmware or software routines (stored in rom) immediately after a computer or other digital electronic device is powered. it check devices connected with computer.
	- 2. booting : load os on ram (form secondary memory) , program name bootsrap (stored in rom)  
	- 3. rom work end and ram start working ![[Pasted image 20250129105709.png]]
- **RAM work**
	- rom load os then rom work done and ram start work
	- ram keep os and load program ( with help of  os) that we want execute
- **Types of RAM : based on how ram designed**
	- **1. Static RAM (SRAM) :**
		- Made of -> flip-flop
		- No refresh required
		- fast
		- expensive
		- used for cache memory
	- **2. Dynamic RAM  (DRAM) :**
		- Made of -> capacitor (storage in form of electric charges)
		- Periodic refresh is required to keep the content . (because after some time changes , discharge)
		- slower (due to refresh)
		- less expensive
		- used from main memory implementation ![[Pasted image 20250129101132.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250129142307.png]]

---

### **Multiple Chips  in Single System**
### 1. vertical arrangements 
- Used when no of addresses required in memory system is more then in single chip
![[Pasted image 20250129151059.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250129185725.png]]

### 2. Horizontal Arrangement  
- Used when data per location  is required more than one chip data
![[Pasted image 20250129185923.png]]

### 3. Hybrid Arrangment
- Used when data per location and no of addresses both required more then a single chip
![[Pasted image 20250129190516.png]]

 
### **DRAM Cell Management**
- Actualy memory made not a singal  column/row of cell but 
![[Pasted image 20250130101912.png]]
- **DRAM Refresh :** Because in one refresh operation one row of cells can be refreshed so ,
	- 1 Chip Refresh Time = No of Rows of Cells X 1 Refresh time of cells
	- N Chip Refresh Time (in one system) = 1 Chip Refresh Time (because one refresh operation   Refreshed 1 row of cells  in all chips)
	- We can't perform read/write operation during refreshing the DRAM 
- **Refresh Period :**

### **Associative Memory**
- Known as Content Addressable Memory
- Cells do not have addresses
- Faster then SRAM  , expensive
- Which cell have two content , one : which cpu knows , second : which cpu wants . 
- Find info2 with help to search info1 that cpu send 
- searching  opration done parallel on all the cell
![[Pasted image 20250130150640.png]]
- EX1 : can be used to implement TLB (Translation Lookside Buffer)
![[Pasted image 20250130150301.png]] 
- EX2 : can be used to implement cache memory (genrally SRAM used)

---

### **Locality of Reference**
- If CPU has requested one address for memory access . then particular address or nearby addresses will be accessed soon.
- **Types of Locality of Refrence :**
	- 1. Temporal : If same address accessed (referred) soon. (based = time)
	- 2. Spatial : If nearby addresses are accessed(referred) soon .(based = space)
- Use of Locality of Reference : use in cache memory 
---
### **Cache Memory**
- It is a hardware component used for storing frequently accessed data and instructions., generally implement by  SRAM  type chip.
- Based on the Locality of Refrence concept current demanded localities are kept into a smaller & faster memory , known as cache 
- Use of cache reduces CPU's memory access time.
![[Pasted image 20250130171605.png]]
- AKA "on-chip memory" because it is often integrated directly into the processor (CPU).
- **Working Of Cache Memory**
	- Cache Hit : CPU's demanded content is present in cache
	- Cache Miss : CPU's demanded content is content is not present in cache 
	- Perfromace of cache is given by , what hit ratio.
	- **Cache Hit Ratio (H)**= no of hits / total memory refrence . total memory refrence = hit +  miss
	- **Cache Miss Ratio** = 1 - H (cache hit ratio)  ![[Pasted image 20250131111537.png]]
	- In case of miss , CPU goes to main-memory , accesses the required content and then brings the block (which contains demanded content) from main-memory to cache.
	- **Average memory access time :  ![[Pasted image 20250131112429.png]]
- **Types of cache Access**
	- **1. Simultaneous Access (Parallel access) :** parallel send signal to cache and main  ![[Pasted image 20250131113442.png]]
	- **2. Hirerachical Access (Series) :** first send signal for cache if miss then send to main
	- ![[Pasted image 20250131113713.png]]
- To Solve Quesyion : find Average memory access time

### **Cache Write / Write Propagration**
- If CPU updates the content in cache then the original content in main memory also should be updated.  Two ways to do that. 
- **1. Write Through :** immediately write .
	- whenever write on cache also write on main memory.
	- CPU genrate write operation simultaneously for cache and memory.  ![[Pasted image 20250131155153.png]]
	- Adantages : Data consistency \[cache and memory memory hae same values for content] 
	- Disadvatnge:  1. Time consuming because for a write operation m.m is accessed irrespected of hit or miss![[Pasted image 20250131170153.png]] 
- **2. Write Back :**  Write-Back Cache Memory is a caching technique where data is first written to the cache and later updated in the main memory only when necessary (i.e., when the cache block is replaced).![[Pasted image 20250131185200.png]]
	- Advantage : It is time saving 
	- Disadvantage : Data inconsistency  ![[Pasted image 20250131185056.png]]
