### **ARM Assembly Language**
- One of the most popular RISC instruction sets in use today.
- used by licenses of ARM Limited , UK -> ARM processor , some processors by samsung , qualcomn , and apple 
- Highly versatile instruction set 
- Floating-point and vector (multiple operations per instruction ) extensions.

### **ARM Machine Model**
- 16 registers - r0 to r15 (the pc explicitly visible)
	- r11 -> fp (frame pointer)
	- r12 -> ip (intra-procedure-call scratch register)
	- r13 -> sp (stack pointer)
	- r14 -> lr (Link register)/ return address register 
	- r15 -> pc (program counter)
- Memory -> Von Neumann Architecture

### **Data Transfer Instructions**
- mov reg , reg/imm (eg: mov r1,r2/#3)
- mvn reg , reg/imm    

---
### **Arthmetics Instruction**
- add reg, reg, reg/imm
- sub reg, reg,reg/imm
- rsb  reg, reg,reg/imm  (rsb r1 ,r2 , r3 means  r1 = r3 - r2  )
