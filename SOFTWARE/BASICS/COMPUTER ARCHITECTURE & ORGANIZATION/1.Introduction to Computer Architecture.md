### **Computer**
- A computer is a general purpose devices that  can be programmed to process information, and yield meaningful results.
- Architecture :The view of a computer presented to software designers.
- Organisation : The actual implementation of a computer in hardware.
- computer type
  - desktop computer
    - other : watch , calculate,

### **Desktop computer**
- **main components (3):**
  - cpu / processor / computer
  - main memory / ram
  - hard disk / rom 
- **peripheral components** 
  - mouse , keyboard : for input
  - moniter , printer : for output

### **Instruction**
- An instruction is defined as a basic command that can be given to a computer.
- computer can understand instruction like "show the time", they understand like - add a + b , multiply a , c
**instruction set**
  - The number of basic instructions/rudimentary commands that a processor can support have to be finite. This set of instructions is typically called the instruction set.
  - Some examples of basic instructions are: add, subtract, multiply, logical or, and logical not. 
  - each instruction needs to work on a set of variables and constants,and finally save the result in a variable.
  - driven by ISA (instruction set architecture)
 **ISA**
- The semantics of all the instructions supported by a processor is known as the instruction set architecture (ISA). 
- This includes the semantics of the instructions themselves, along with their operands, and interfaces with peripheral devices.
- ISA example:
	-  Intel and AMD CPUs use the x86 instruction set
	- IBM processors use the PowerPC® instruction set
	- HP processors use the PA-RISC instruction set
	- ARM processors use the ARM® instruction set ( variants Thumb-1 and Thumb-2)
- It is thus not possible to run a binary compiled for an Intel system on an ARM based system.
- example of intructions in an ISA
	- arthmetics instruction : add, sub, mul, div
	- logical instruction : and, or, not
	- data transfer/movement instruction

### **How to intruct a Computer**
![[Pasted image 20241116101010.png]]
- write program in programming language - c , c++ , java.
- compile it into a format that the computer understands (0s and 1s).
- execute the program.

### **Instruction Set Design**
- process of desiging an instruction for a processor
- We can think of an instruction set as a legal contract between software and hardware. The software part needs to ensure that all the programs that users write can be successfully and efficiently translated to basic instructions. Likewise, hardware needs to ensure that all the instructions in the instruction set are efficiently implementable.
- An ISA needs to have some necessary properties and some desirable properties for efficiency.
	- **Complete (necessary)** - The ISA should be able to Implement all User Programs.
	- **Concise** – Limited Size of the Instruction Set. We should ideally not have a lot of instructions .Implementing a lot of instructions will unnecessarily increase the number of transistors in the processor and increase its complexity.most instruction sets have somewhere between 64 to 1000 instructions.MIPS instruction set contains 64 instructions, whereas the Intel x86 instruction set has roughly a 1000 instructions as of 2012. Note that 1000 is considered a fairly large number for the number of instructions in an ISA.
	- **Generic** – Instructions should Capture the Common Case.Most of the common instructions in programs are simple arithmetic instructions such as add, subtract, multiply, divide. The most common logical instructions are logical and, or, exclusiveor, and not. Hence, it makes sense to dedicate an instruction to each of these common operations. It is not a good idea to have instructions that implement a very rarely used computation. For example, it might not make sense to implement an instruction that computes sin−1 (x).
	- **Simple** – Instructions should be Simple.

### **RISC and  CISC** 
**RISC**
- A reduced instruction set computer (RISC) implements simple instructions that have a simple and regular structure.
- The number of instructions is typically a small number (64 to 128). Examples: ARM, IBM PowerPC, HP PA-RISC.
**CISC**
- A complex instruction set computer (CISC) implements complex instructions that are highly irregular, take multiple operands, and implement complex functionalities.
- Secondly, the number of instructions is large (typically 500+). Examples: Intel x86, VAX
**Conclusion**
- Modern processors typically use a hybrid approach where they have simple, as well as some complicated instructions.
- However, under the hood CISC instructions are translated into RISC instructions. Hence, we believe that the scale tilts slightly more towards RISC instructions. We shall thus consider it a desirable property to have simple instructions.

### **Completeness of an ISA**
- ISA complete means , isa can implement all types of programs. 
- for example , if we just have add instructions , we can't subtract(so isa not complete).
- Ensure that we have just enough instruction such that we can implement every possible program that we might want to write.
- find answer of this question by universal machine.

### **Universal Machine**
- A machine that can execute any program is known as a universal machine. 
- We can treat each basic action of this machine as an instruction. Thus the set of actions of a universal machine is its ISA, and this ISA is complete. (universal ISA = universal machine = ISA complete).
- Alan Turing was the first to propose a universal machine that was extremely simple and powerful. This machine is aptly named after him, and is known as the Turing machine.

### **Turing Machine**
-  Alan Turing was the first to propose a universal machine that was extremely simple and powerful. This machine is aptly named after him, and is known as the Turing machine.
- A Turing Machine is a theoretical computational model introduced by **Alan Turing** in 1936. It is fundamental to the theory of computation and serves as a simplified abstract representation of a computer. Turing Machines are used to study what problems are computable and how efficiently they can be solved.
- Alan Turing know as father of the computer science.

**Components of a Turing Machine:**
1. **Infinite Tape**:  Represents the machine's memory. It is divided into discrete cells, each of which can hold a single symbol from a finite alphabet.
2. **Tape Head**: Can move left (L) or right (R) along the tape. It reads and writes symbols on the tape.
3. **State Register**:  Keeps track of the machine's current state.
4. **Transition Function / Action Table**: - Defines how the machine transitions between states based on:
    - The current state.
    - The symbol currently under the tape head.
- For each `(old state, old symbol)` pair, it specifies:
    - The new state.
    - The new symbol to write on the tape.
    - The direction to move the tape head (left or right).
