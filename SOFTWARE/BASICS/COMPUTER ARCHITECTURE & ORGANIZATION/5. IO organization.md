### **Peripheral / I-O Devices **
- Devices connected to processor externally except main memory (because cpu and memory directly connected through the three buses and no need i-o interface). 
- Three type of peripheral/i-o devices
	- **1. Input devices** :** keyboard , mouse , camera
	- **2. output devices :** screen printer 
	- **3. storage devices :** hard disk , sd card , pen drive , cd
- CPU can't access IO directly because cpu is a purely electronic device and work on electronic signal  but all io devices are not electronic device and not generate  electronic signal . solution is  i-o interface .

- **Need of  IO interface**
	- 1. Peripherals are electromechanical or electromagnetic devices; and their manner of operation is different from the operation of the CPU and memory, which are electronic devices. So conversion of signal is required.
	- 2. The data transfer rate of peripherals is usually slow. So synchronization is required.
	- 3. Data codes and format in peripherals differ from the word format in the CPU and memory. So conversion of formats is required.
	- 4. The operating modes of peripherals are different from each other and each must be controlled so a peripheral does not disturb the operation of other peripherals.   
- **DMA Controller** :  DMA + interface 
-  **I-O processor** : DMA + interface + i-o instrcution execution. EX: graphic card
