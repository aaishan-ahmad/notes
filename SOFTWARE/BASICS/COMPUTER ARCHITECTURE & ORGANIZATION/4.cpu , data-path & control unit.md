### **CPU**
- It is a brain of a computer , containing all the circurity needed to process input , store data , and output results.
- Clock Rate : How many micro-operation a cpu can perform per second .  
- **CPU Cycle time** : Time CPU takes to perform a micro-operation

- **CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) :** How many cycle need to complete a instruction . It can be diffrent for diffrente type of instrcution 
- **Average CPI :** Consider computing the overall CPI for a machine A for which the following perfomance measurment were recorded when executing a set of benchmark programs. Assume that the clock rate of the CPU is 200MHZ , Total no of instrcutions = 200

CPI for a processor is not constant it depend on how many no of instruction we are executing of what type.
- **Execution Time for 1 instruction :** CPI \* Cycle time = CPI / Clock rate
- **Exection Time for n instruction :** n * CPI * Cycle Time = ( n * CPI ) / Clock rate . {CPI = avg}

### **Datapath**
- Design of cpu called datapath
- Collection of functional units such as arthmetic logic units or multiplexers 
- Perform data processing operations

### **Control Unit**
- It generates control signal and send to various componets of computer. All componets operate according to these control signals.
- **Control Variable :** Name of a control signal. Ex : read , write , IN , OUT
- **Control Word :** Collection of signals generated by control unit at once

control unit generates control word ,in that control word the signals are send to their respective components and components operates so that a micro-operation can be performed.
- **Types of Control Unit (bases of how control unit genrate signals)** 
	- 1. Hardwired control unit 
		- Control logic is implemented with gates , flip-flops , decoders and other digital circuits.
		- Advantages : Can be optimized to produce a faster mode of opereation.
		- Disadvantages : Rearranging the wires among varou components is difficult( means updation in control logic is difficult).
	- 2. Microprogrammed control unit
