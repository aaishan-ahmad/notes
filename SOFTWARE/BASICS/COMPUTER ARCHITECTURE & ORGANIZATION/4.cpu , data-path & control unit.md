### **CPU**
- It is a brain of a computer , containing all the circurity needed to process input , store data , and output results.
- Clock Rate : How many micro-operation a cpu can perform per second .  
- **CPU Cycle time** : Time CPU takes to perform a micro-operation

- **CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) :** How many cycle need to complete a instruction . It can be diffrent for diffrente type of instrcution 
- **Average CPI :** Consider computing the overall CPI for a machine A for which the following perfomance measurment were recorded when executing a set of benchmark programs. Assume that the clock rate of the CPU is 200MHZ , Total no of instrcutions = 200

CPI for a processor is not constant it depend on how many no of instruction we are executing of what type.
- **Execution Time for 1 instruction :** CPI \* Cycle time = CPI / Clock rate
- **Exection Time for n instruction :** n * CPI * Cycle Time = ( n * CPI ) / Clock rate . {CPI = avg}

- Used to give CPU's performance
