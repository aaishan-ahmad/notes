### **Instruction**
- The commands to CPU for performming operation.
- A group of bits which instructs computer ro perform some operation.

- Type of instruction identify by type of operation(op-code)
- ISA(Instruction Set Architecture) : Collection of all instructions supported by a CPU.

### **Types of Instruction**
- **Based on operations**
	- Data Transfer : MOV , LDI , LDA
	- Arithmetic & Logic : ADD , SUB , AND , OR
	- Machine Control : EI , DI , PUSH , POP
	- Iterative : LOOP , LOOPE, LOOPZ
	- Branch : JMP , CALL , RET , JZ , JNZ
- **Based on operands**
	- 3-Address Instrcution : max 3 address can be specified within instrcution

	- 2-Address Instruction : max 2 address can be specified within instrcution

	- 1-Address Instrcution : max 1 address can be specified within instrcution

	- 0-Address Instrcution : none

### **Instruction Length**
- 1. Fixed Length Instruction
- 2. Variable Lenth Instruction

---
### **How Instructions Generated**
- High Level Lang -----> (compile ) ----> Low level lang/ machine code (instruction)
- Compiler generate instructions based on CPU , means only those type of instructions it will genrate which are supported by CPU. 

---
### **How Instruction Executed**
- **Effective Address**
- 6-Steps are required to execute an instruction
