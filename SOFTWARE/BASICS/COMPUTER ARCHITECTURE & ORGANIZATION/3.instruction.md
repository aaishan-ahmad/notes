### **Digital Computer**
- A computer (CPU) that take input in binary and give output in binary callled digital computer.

### **Instruction**
- The commands to CPU for performming operation.
- A group of bits which instructs computer ro perform some operation.
![[Pasted image 20250113145202.png]]
- Type of instruction identify by type of operation(op-code)
- **ISA(Instruction Set Architecture)** : Collection of all instructions supported by a CPU.

### **Types of Instruction**
- **Based on operations**
	- Data Transfer : MOV , LDI , LDA
	- Arithmetic & Logic : ADD , SUB , AND , OR
	- Machine Control : EI , DI , PUSH , POP
	- Iterative : LOOP , LOOPE, LOOPZ
	- Branch : JMP , CALL , RET , JZ , JNZ
- **Based on operands**
	- 3-Address Instrcution : max 3 address can be specified within instrcution
	![[Pasted image 20250113163654.png]]
	- 2-Address Instruction : max 2 address can be specified within instrcution
	![[Pasted image 20250113163236.png]]
	- 1-Address Instrcution : max 1 address can be specified within instrcution
	![[Pasted image 20250113162450.png]]
	- 0-Address Instrcution : none

### **Instruction Length**
- 1. Fixed Length Instruction
- 2. Variable Lenth Instruction

---
### **How Instructions Generated**
- High Level Lang -----> (compile ) ----> Low level lang/ machine code (instruction)
- Compiler generate instructions based on CPU , means only those type of instructions it will genrate which are supported by CPU. 

---
### **How Instruction Executed**
- **Effective Address** : use memory address
- 6-Steps are required to execute an instruction

### **Addressing mode**
- It specifies how and from where the oprands are obtained for a instrcution.![[Pasted image 20250114184019.png]]
- **Types of Addressing mode**
	- **1. Implied Mode** : The opcode definition itself defines the operand. EX : INCA (Increment Accumulator).
	- **2. Immediate Mode :** The address fields of instruction specifies the operand value. It is used to initialize registers with constant value. 
	- **3. Direct / Absolute Mode :**  The address field instruction specifies the effective address (memory address).
	- **4. Indirect Mode :** The address field of instruction specifies the address of effective address. No of memory access to get the operand = 2  . pointer application ![[Pasted image 20250114165602.png]]
	- **5. Register / Reg direct Mode :** The address field of instruction specifies a register which holds operand
	- **6. Register Indirect Mode :**  The address field of instrcution specifies the register which holds  effective address. It is used to shorten the length of instruction. One register + One memory access require to get the operand![[Pasted image 20250114174752.png]]
	- **7. Autoincrement - Autodecrement Mode :** Variant register indirect mode , in which the content of register is automatically incremented or decremented to access the sequential data.![[Pasted image 20250114190859.png]]
	- **8. Indexed / Index Register Mode :**  ![[Pasted image 20250114194442.png]]![[Pasted image 20250114194458.png]]![[Pasted image 20250114210010.png]]
	- **9. PC-Relative Mode :** PC value added in address field value (offset) of instruction to get effective address. Used for branch instruction **(intera segment branching)**.
		- **Branch Instruction :** if-else , loop , jump
		- pc-relative mode aka positiona independent mode
		- ![[Pasted image 20250115153952.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20250115154204.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20250115154032.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20250115154328.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20250115153715.png]]
	- **10. Base Register Mode :** same pc-relative but this use for inter segment branching
	- ![[Pasted image 20250115165609.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20250115165019.png]]
- First 6 mode is **Non-computable Mode** and else **Computable-Mode**
![[Pasted image 20250115165211.png]]
- Pc-relative and base register mode both supports reallocation . and both calculate target address(Effective address).
