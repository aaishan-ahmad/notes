### **Syllabus : IIT SIR smruti .R. sarangi**
- Chapter 1 - introduction to Computer Architecture
- In Chapter 2, we shall study the language of bits. We shall see that using bits it is possible to express logical concepts, arithmetic concepts (integer and real numbers), and pieces of text.Assembly language is a textual representation of an ISA. It is specific to the ISA. Since an instruction is a sequence of 0s and 1s, it is very difficult to study it in its bare form. Assembly language gives us a good handle to study the semantics of instructions in an ISA.
- Chapter 3 introduces the general concepts of assembly language and serves as a common introduction to the next two chapters that delve into the details of two very popular real world ISAs – ARM and x86. We introduce a simple ISA called SimpleRisc in Chapter 3.
- Subsequently, in Chapter 4 we introduce the ARM ISA , and in Chapter 5 we briefly cover the x86 ISA. Note that it is not necessary to read both these chapters.
- After reading the introductory chapter on assembly language and obtaining an understanding of the SimpleRisc assembly language, the interested reader can read just one chapter to deepen her knowledge about a real world ISA. At this point, the reader should have a good knowledge of what needs to be built
- In this part, we shall actually build a basic computer. Chapter 7 will start out with the basic building blocks of a processor – logic gates, registers, and memories. Readers who have already taken a digital design course can skip this chapter.
- Chapter 8 deals with computer arithmetic. It introduces detailed algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for both integers as well as real numbers. Most computers today perform very heavy numerical computations. Hence, it is necessary to obtain a firm understanding of how numerical operations are actually implemented, and get an idea of the tradeoffs of different designs.
- After these two chapters, we would be ready to actually design a simple processor in Chapter 9. We shall assemble a simple processor part by part, and then look at two broad design styles –hardwired, and micro-programmed. Modern processors are able to process many instructions simultaneously, and have complex logic for taking the dependences across instructions into account.
- The most popular technique in this area is known as pipelining. We shall discuss pipelining in detail in Chapter 10.
- By this point, we would have gotten a fair understanding of how simple processors are designed. We shall proceed to optimise the design, add extra components, and make a full system that can support all the programs that users typically want to run. We shall describe three subsystems – Memory System We shall see in Chapter 11 that it is necessary to build a fast and efficient memory system, because it is a prime driver of performance. To build a fast memory system, we need to introduce many new structures and algorithms.
- Multiprocessors Nowadays, vendors are incorporating multiple processors on a single chip. The future belongs to multiprocessors. The field of multiprocessors is very extensive and typically forms the core of an advanced architecture course. In this book, we shall provide a short overview of multiprocessors in Chapter 12.
- I/O and Storage In Chapter 13, we shall look at methods to interface with different I/O devices, especially storage devices such as the hard disk. The hard disk saves all our programs and data when the computer is powered off, and it also plays a crucial role in supplying data to our programs during their operations. Hence, it is necessary to study the structure of the hard disk, and optimise it for performance and reliability.
- 1.9.2 Further Reading The field of computer architecture is a very exciting and fast moving field. The reader can refer to the books by Jan Bergstra [Bergstra and Middelburg, 2012] and Gilreath [Gilreath and Laplante, 2003] to learn more about the theory of instruction set completeness and classes of instructions. The book on formal languages by by Hopcroft, Motwani, and Ulmann [Hopcroft et al., 2006] provides a good introduction to Turing machines and theoretical computer science in general. To get a historical perspective, readers can refer to the original reports written by Alan Turing [Carpenter and Doran, 1986] and John von Neumann [von Neumann, 1945].
