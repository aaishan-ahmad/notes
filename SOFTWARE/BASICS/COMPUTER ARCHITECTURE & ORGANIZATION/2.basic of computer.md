### **Components of Computer**
- **CPU** 
	- Control Unit : 
	- ALU (Artimetic Logical Unit) :
- **Memory**
	- Primary Memory : RAM , ROM
	- Secondary Memory / Auxilary  : HDD , SDD
- **I/O Devices** 
	- Input :
	- Output : 
- Other Components
	- **System Bus** : Collection of communication line between components of computer
		- ![[Pasted image 20250107190405.png]]
		- 3 Types: based on type of content the bus carries
		- 1. Address Bus
		- 2. Data Bus
		- 3. Control Bus ![[Pasted image 20250107191311.png]]
		
	- **CPU Register** : Small storage inside CPU

### **Register /CPU Register**
- small storage inside CPU
- 2 Types
- **1. General Purpose (GPR)** : R0 , R1 , R3 , R4 , ....
- **2. Special Purpose (SPR)**
	- Accumulator (AC) :  Used to store result of ALU and sometimes one of the operand for ALU too.![[Pasted image 20250112143145.png]]
	- Program Counter (PC) : Used to store address of next instruction to be exectuted
	- Instruction Register (IR) : Used to store current instruction
	- Stack Pointer (SP) : Used to store address of the top of the stack
	- Flag Register / Program Status Word(PSW) / Status Register : Used to store status of ALU result.![[Pasted image 20250112143909.png]]
	- Address Register (AR) /Memory Address Register (MAR) : Used to send address to memory.
	- Data Register (DR) / Memory Data Register (MDR) / Memory Buffer Register (MBR) : Used to send data to memory (memory write) & to receive data fom memory (memory read)

### **Types of Architectutre**
- Based on ALU  input :
- **1. AC-Based Architecture**
	-  ALU takes one input form AC ![[Pasted image 20250112153245.png]]
- **2. Register Based Architecture **![[Pasted image 20250112152948.png]]
- **3. Register-Memory Based Architecture** ![[Pasted image 20250112162128.png]]
- **4. Complex System Architecture**![[Pasted image 20250112162255.png]]
- **5. Stack Based Architecure (Not used today, oldest)**

### **Micro-Operation**
- The operation executed on values stored in registers.
- Micro-operation aka atomic operation
- RTL (Register Transfer Language) : Symbolic Notation to describe the micro-operation
	-  Register Transfer : R1 <- R2 (OR) R2 -> R1 (Transfer content of register R2 to R1)
	- comma : R1 <- R2 ,  PC <- PC + 1  parllel operation seprater',' .(both micro-op can be performed simultaneously only when both require mutually exclusive set of components)
	- Memory Transfer : R1 <- M\[address]  for read , M\[address] <- R1 for write on memory
