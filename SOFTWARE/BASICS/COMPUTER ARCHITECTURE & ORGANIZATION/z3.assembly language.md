### **What is Assembly Lanuage**
- A low level programming language uses simple statements that correspond to typically just one machine instruction. These languages are specific to the ISA.
- The term “assembly language” refers to a family of low-level programming languages that are specific to an ISA. They have a generic structure that consists of a sequence of assembly statements.
- Typically, each assembly statement has two parts:
	- (1) an instruction code that is a mnemonic for a basic machine instruction,
	- (2) and a list of operands.

### **Why**
- Write highly efficient code Suitable for the core parts of games, and mission critical software.
- Write code for operating systems and device drivers.
- Use features of the machine that are not supported by standard programming languages

---
### **Assemblers**
- Assemblers are programs that convert programs written in low level languages to machine code (0s and 1s).
- Examples : nasm, tasm, and masm for x86 ISAs.
- On a linux system try :
	- gcc -S <filename.c> ( convert .c to assembly)
	- filename.s is its assembly representation
	- Then type: gcc filename.s (will generate a binary: a.out)

### **View of Registers**
- Registers (general purpose) → named storage locations 
	- in ARM : r0, r1, … r15 
	- in x86 : eax, ebx, ecx, edx, esi, edi
- Machine specific registers (MSR)
	- Examples : Control the machine such as the speed of fans, power control settings
	- Read the on-chip temperature.
- Registers with special functions :
	- stack pointer
	- program counter
	- return address

### **View of Memory**
![[Pasted image 20241125094543.png]]
**Memory**
- One large array of bytes
- Each location has an address
- The address of the first location is 0, and increases by 1 for each subsequent location
- The program is stored in a part of the memory.
- The program counter contains the address of the current instruction.
**Storage of data in memory**
- data types
	- char ( 1 bytes)
	- short (2 bytes)
	- int (4 bytes)
	- long int  (8 bytes)
