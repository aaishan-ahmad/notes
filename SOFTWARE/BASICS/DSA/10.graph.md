### **Graph**
- Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertex) and edges.
### Representation
- **1. Adjacency Table** ![[Pasted image 20250222184112.png]]
	- Disadvantage : We store information of those edges also which are not present in graph. 
- **2. Linked List / Adjency  Representation**![[Pasted image 20250222185934.png]]
	- Advantage : Only those edges information are stored , which are present.
	- Disadantge : We can't goto any specific vertex directly(randomly)
- **3. Hybrid Representation**![[Pasted image 20250222192412.png]]

### **Traversing in Graph**
- **1. Breadth First Search (BSF)**
- **2. Depth First Search (DFS)**
