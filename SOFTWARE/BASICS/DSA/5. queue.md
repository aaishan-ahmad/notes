### **Queue**
- A linear data structure in which insertion can be done from one end (rear end ) and deletion is done from other end (front end)
- Known as  FIFO (first in first out) list 
- Operations on queue:
	- Enqueue : Insetion  
	- Dequeue : Deletion
	- IsEmptyQueue : true  , when queue is empty else false
	- QueueFront : return front element of queue without any change in queue
	- QueueRear : return rear element of queue without any change in queue

### **Queue Implementation Using Liked List**
- Optimal then array implementation

### **Double Ended  Queue**
- In which insertion and deletion can be performed from both ends
- There are two types of double ended queue
	- 1. Input Restricted : Input is restricted to standard end (Rear End)
	- 2. Output Restricted : Output is restricted to standard end (Front end) ![[Pasted image 20250212182551.png]]

### **Application of Queue**
- Serving requests on a single resource , like a printer , CPU task scheduling , disk scheduling etc.
- When data is transferred asynchronously between two processes . Examples include IO Buffers, pipes, file IO , etc.
- Call center phone systems uses queues to hold people.
- Handling of interrupts in real-time systems.
- Breadth First Search (BFS).
- Level order traversal of tree.

---
### **Priority Queue**
- Each element in the queue has associated priority & for dequeue highest priority element is deleted.
- Implementation 
	- 1. Priority Handling at insertion Time :  Insertion new element in such a way that the front element is always the highest priority elements and all elements should be in decreasing order of priority.
