### **Need of AVL Tree**
- We wanted intertion , deletion and seaching  complexity log(n) but in BST only possible in best or average case (when we had balance tree).
- NOTE : balance tree : h = log(n) where n = no of element
- we need to maintain a BST always balanced. 



### **AVL Tree**
- AVL tree is self balancing BST.
- self balancing meand whenever there is an insertion or deletion the tree maintains balance.
- AVL : Adelson , velsky and Lendis 
- Self balancing method :
	- Each node should be haing balance factor -1 or 0 or 1 
	- Balance factor = h<sub>L</sub> - h<sub>R</sub>  { where h<sub>L</sub> is height of left subtree and h<sub>R</sub> is height of right subtree}![[Pasted image 20250220113624.png]]
	- Type of Imbalances & its solution while insertion
