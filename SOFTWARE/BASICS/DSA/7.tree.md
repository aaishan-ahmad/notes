### **Tree**
- Non-linear hirearchy data strcuture that consists of nodes connected by edges
- n nodes => n-1 edges
- Tree terminologies
	- 1. Root : 
	- 2. Child : 
	- 3. Parent : 
	- 4. Sibling :
	- 5. Subtree : 
	- 6. Internal node : node with atleast  one child 
	- 7. External node (leaf node) : node with zero child
	- 8. Level : start with 0 
- A node either be internal or external
- Total nodes = internal node + external node

### **Binary Tree**
- A tree which each node has maximum of 2 children
- child must be explicitly left or right
- Linked Representation
