### **Array**
- Collection of homogenous elements-  **Characteristic :**
- All elements stored on consecutive memory locations
	- All elements can be accessed using a set of indexes
- **Define : in dsa**
	- name\[LB:UB] , LB<=UB
	- size of array = UB - LB + 1
- **Insertion** 
	- At the end = O (1) OR Θ (1)
	- Based on index = Θ (n)
- **Deletion**
	- At the end = O (1) OR Θ (1)
	- Based on index = Θ (n) 
- **Searching**
	- Linear : O(n)
	- Binary : prerequisite = array should be sorted , O (log n)

### **2D Array**
- Collection of 1-D array
- **Define : in dsa**
	- name \[ LB<sub>i</sub> : UB<sub>i</sub> ] \[ LB<sub>j</sub> : UB<sub>j</sub> ] 
	- no of rows(m) = UB<sub>i</sub> - LB<sub>i</sub> + 1
	- no of columns(n) = UB<sub>j</sub> - LB<sub>j</sub> + 1
	- Size of array = m x n 
- **Storage** 
	- we know the array stores in consucatie location
	- Row major order :  first row , each element then second row each element and so on ![[Pasted image 20250209150346.png]]
	- Column major order : first column , each element then second column each element and and so on    ![[Pasted image 20250209150857.png]]

### **Sparse Matrix**
- A sparse matrix is a matrix with many zero elements, which are not stored in memory. This representation is more efficient than storing every element in a matrix.
- **Storage -** We know that a sparse matrix contains lesser non-zero elements than zero, so less memory can be used to store elements. It evaluates only the non-zero elements.
- **Computing time:** In the case of searching in sparse matrix, we need to traverse only the non-zero elements rather than traversing all the sparse matrix elements. It saves computing time by logically designing a data structure traversing non-zero elements.

- Implement sparse matrix representation using arrays and linked lists
- Implement efficient storage of triangular matrices
- Convert between sparse and dense matrices

### **Lower Triangular Matrix**
- A square matrix (m=n) where all elements above the main diagonal are zero.
- A<sub> i , j</sub> = 0  ,where i\<j 
- so we only store A\[ i>=j]  , because we know else elements are always 0.

### **Upper Triangular Matrix**
- A square matrix (m=n) where all elements below the main diagonal are zero.
- A<sub> i , j</sub> = 0 , where i > j
- so we only store A\[ i<=j]  , because we know else elements are always 0.
