### **Algorithm**
- Step by step solution for algorithmic problem

### **Analysis of Algorithm**
When to compare multiple solution for a problem.
We need to compare between or among the algorithm to best algorithm to solve the problem so we compare algrithm based on the two parameter.
- 1.Space Complexity
	- Space neded to run algorithm  (except input size)
- 2.Run-time Complexity
	- Time needed to run the alorithm 
	- To calculate we have two option 
		- 1. Wall-clock time : not use 
		- 2. Number of operation  OR how many steps : use 
- Now these days space complexity is not big concern but run-time complexity

### **Rate of Growth**
- At what rate the complexity increases when no of inputs increases.
- Time(T) ∝ No of inputs (n)

### **Complexity Notation**
- constant - 1 (complexity is not dependent on  input size)
- logarithmic - log(n)
-                  - √n
- linear - n
- log linear - n log(n) 
- quadratic - n<sup>2</sup>
- cubic - n<sup>3</sup> ....
- exponential - 2<sup>n</sup>
-                      - 3<sup>n</sup> ..... 
-                       - n<sup>n</sup>

### **Asymptotic Notation**
- 1. Big O : It gives tighest upper bound
- 2. Omega Ω : It gives tighest lower bound
- 3. Theta Θ : Avg bound (exact bound)

### **Types of inputs / analysis
- 1.Best case
- 2.Average case
- 3.Worst case
