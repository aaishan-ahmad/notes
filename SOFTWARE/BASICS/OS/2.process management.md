### **What is Process**
- A program under execution called process.
- process = program + runtime activity
- defination for different  prespective
	- An instance of a program 
	- Scheduable/Dispatchable unit: (CPU)
	- Unit of execution : (CPU)
	- Locus of control : (OS)

### **Process as Data Strcuture**
- **Definition :** Code or Only program
- **Representation/ Implementation :** How process stored in memory 
![[Pasted image 20241212183937.png]]
- **Operation :**
	- Create (Resource allocation)
	- Schedule, Run
	- Wait/Block
	- Suspend/Resume
	- Terminate (Resource deallocation)
- **Attributes :**  
	- PID (Process ID)
	- PC
	- GPR
	- List of Devices
	- Types
	- Size
	- Memory Limits 
	- Priority
	- State
	- List of files 
	- NOTE : OS store these attribute in a data structure called PCB (Process Control Block) aka Process descriptor
	- ![[Pasted image 20241212191701.png]]
	- Context : The content of PCB of a process are collectively know as "Context" of that process.
	- Context Switch : context save (pcb p1) and other context load(pcb p2) , in simple word stop a running process and run another. context switching done by dispatcher(a function of a os).
### **Process State**
![[Pasted image 20241213105530.png]]
- Process states
	- **New** : All installed processor are in known to be in new state
	- **Ready** : All processes which are waiting to run on CPU are known to be in ready state
	- **Running** : A process which is running on CPU has its state as runing.
	- **Terminated** : A completed process has its state as terminted.
	- **Blocked/Waiting** : All process which are waiting for any IO or Event.
- Process state transition
	- **New to Ready** : When process is admitted (done by OS) 
	- **Ready to Running**: When a process is dispatched to CPU (done by OS)
	- **Runing to Terminated** : When a process is completed (done by process)
	- **Running to Blocked** :When a process goes for I/O or event. (done by process)
	- **Running to Ready** : When a process is preempted. (done by OS)
	- **Blocked to Ready** : When a process completes IO or event. (done by OS)
	- NOTE : two transition are voluntary (running to terminated and running to bloacked)

### **CPU vs IO Bound Process**
- **CPU Bound** : If the process is intensive in terms of CPU operations. in simple word use cpu mucher. EX: comilation, text editor
- **IO  Bound**: If the process is intensive in terms of IO operations. in simple word use IO mucher. EX: watching video or listening song

### **Process Sheduling**
- Process scheduling is a core task of an operating system (OS) that manages the execution of processes in an efficient manner. It ensures the CPU and other resources are used effectively, maximizing performance and minimizing waiting time.
- **Sheduling queues**
	- Job queue - all process which are in new state
	- Ready queue - all process which are in ready state
	- Device queue -  all process which are waiting of a specific devices
	![[Pasted image 20241213122605.png]]
- All queue will have PCBs of processes in mm (OS). 
- **Types of Schedular**
	- **Long-term Scheduler (JOB schedul)** : schedule/bring the processes form new state (job queue) to ready state (ready queue). means aditted operation done by long term schedular. so in case resource allocation happens.long term schedular can admit the process in two way 1. initiated by user 2. initiated by os.
	- **Short-term Scheduler (CPU scheduling)** : It select one of all ready process to run on cpu. property should in CPU sheduler/Short-term Scheduler are 1.Minimize wait time and Turn-around time, 2. Maximize CPU utilization (throughput), 3. Fairness  
	- **Mid-term Scheduler (Medium term )** : does swiping (m.m to secondar and vis-versa).  swapping aka rolling (if swapping done based on priority of processes). When a process swap-out then state of the process is suspended               ![[Pasted image 20241213185657.png]]

	-  swap out aka sleep and swap in aka wake-up
