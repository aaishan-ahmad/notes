### **Memory managment**
- Module of os 
- Functions of memory management
	- 1. Memory allocation
	- 2. Memory deallocation 
	- 3. Memory Protection 
- Goal of memory management 
	- 1. Maximum utilization of space (minimum memory fragmentation).
	- 2. Ability to run larger programs with limited space. (using virtul memory concept)tion

### **Memory Management Techiniques**
- Contiguous  : Entire process should be stored in main memory on consecutive Locations. 
	- There are two type of techniques
	- 1. Fixed partition
	- 2. Variable partition 
- Non-Contiguous : Entire process is not necessarily to store in main memory on consecutive locations.
	- There are also two type of techniques 
	- 1. Paging 
	-  2. Segmentation

### **Continguous Memory Management**
- Entire process should be stored on consecutive memory locations
- ### 1. Fixed partition contiguous MMT
	- The main memory is divided into fixed number of patition and each partition can be used to accommodate maximum one process 
	- Max degree of mutilprogramming(no of process) is limited by number of partitions.
	- Partition allocation policy 
		- 1. First Fit
		- 2. Best Fit 
		- 3. Worst Fit
		- 4. Next Fit ![[Pasted image 20241230140441.png]]
	- Whichever policy is used => There is a internal fragmentation(If extra space is allocated to process , more than required space. Hence wastage of that extra space is known as internal fragmentation)
	- ![[Pasted image 20241230144610.png]]
- ### 2. Variable Partition Contiguous MMT
	- Main memory is not divided into partitions initially 
	- When a new process arrives , a new partition is created of same size as process size and the process is allocated into the partition.
	- Hence no any internal fragmentation
	- ![[Pasted image 20241230150420.png]]
	- But There is a external fragmentation(If enough space is available to store a process but not consecutive hence wastage of space is known as external fragmentation).
	- The solution of external fragmentation : Compaction (Collect entire allocated processes into one side of memory , so that other side of memory can have entire free space)
	- ![[Pasted image 20241230152051.png]]
	- Compaction is costly process means its take time.
	- So variable partition contiguous suffer from external fragmentation, but not internal fragmentation.

### **Non-Contiguous Memory Management Techniques**
- Process is scattered in memory , not allocated at one area.
- Entire process is not necessarily to store in main memory on consecutive locations.
### 1. Paging
- Scattered in same size of memory areas
- Process is divided in equal size of pages
-  Physical memory(main memory) is divided in same equal size of frames
- Pages are scattered in frames ![[Pasted image 20241231093218.png]] ![[Pasted image 20241231093034.png]]
- Page table is used to map a process page to a physical frame
- Page table is also stored in main memory , in fram of pages.
- Page table manage by OS.
- Whenever CPU requests a specific content,
	- 1.find out content in which page
	- 2.search page table & get the frame no in which the page is stored .
	- 3.goto that frame no & get the content fram.
- Two time the physical memory (main memory) is accessed
	- one for page table
	- one for content

- **Time Required in Paging**
	- Effective memory access time(T<sub>eff</sub>)= page table access time + content access time from mm .
	- By default page table(P.T) is stored in mm so   T<sub>eff</sub> = 2t<sub>mm</sub>  , where t<sub>mm</sub> = mm access time
	- Special case : If P.T is very small and is stored in regester
		-  => T<sub>eff</sub> = t<sub>mm</sub>  , becuase Reg access time is negligible
	- Performance Improvment : TLB is used to improve the performance of paging 
- **TLB (Translation Lookside Buffer)**
	- TLB is used to improve the performance of pagging
	- A translation lookside buffer is a memory hardware that is used to reduce the time taken to access a user memory location.
	- It stores few frequently accessed page table entries so that CPU can get physical address without accessing the main memory in less time
	- ![[Pasted image 20250103103105.png]]
	- TLB HIT : Required page table entry is present in TLB.
	- TLB MISS : Required page table entry is not present in TLB.![[Pasted image 20250103103648.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20250103104418.png]]

	- ![[Pasted image 20250103104539.png]]
	- **TLB MAPPING** 
		- TLB is searched using page no of logical address.
		- Pattern to bring page table entry into TLB known as TLB mapping
		- There are three types of mapping
		- 1.Fully associative mapping 
			- using content accessable memory (does not have addresses)
			- ![[Pasted image 20250103121743.png]]
		- 2.Direct mapping![[Pasted image 20250103122014.png]]
			 ![[Pasted image 20250103150546.png]]
			 
		- 3.Set-associative mapping

 - **INVERTED PAGE TABLE**
### 2. Segmentation
- Scattered in variable size of memory areas 
- Divide process in logoically related partitions (Segments)
- Segments are scattered in physical memory 
- Segments can be of variable sizes
![[Pasted image 20250104175905.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250104182234.png]]
- Size of segment can very , so along with base , keep limit information also.
- Limit defines max number of words or bytes within the segment
	- used to provide memory protection 
- Here also **TLB** same as in paging 
- **SEGMENTAIZATION**

### **Virtual Memory**
- Feature/concept of OS
- Enables to run larger process with smaller avaliable memory ![[Pasted image 20250105163558.png]]
- **Demand Paging**
	- Brings pages in memory when CPU demands
	- If CPU demands a page which is not avaliable in main memory , then it is known as page fault
	- In case of page fault OS brings faulted page from SEcondary memory to main memory by replacing a page (if needed)  & Updates the pagetable and it is called **page fault service**.
	- DMA might require for page fault service.
	- There are two type of demand paging 
	- 1.Pure demand paging : intitially all pages should be in secondary memory when we needed we bring the page in mm. 
	- 2.Demand paging : some pages in m.m and some are in secondary memory 
- **Effective memory access time**
![[Pasted image 20250105152339.png]]
- **Valid bit need** : used to protect memory . it show 0 or 1  that represent page table addresess valid or invalid(garbage in case when page is prsent in secondary memory not in main memory) 
![[Pasted image 20250105163744.png]]
- **Concept of dirty bit or Modified bit** : tell us this page no page updated or not . 0 means while replacement a page is replaced from main memory directly without coping it back to secondary memory. It save time.
![[Pasted image 20250105164731.png]]
- #### Page Replacement policy
	- 1. First in First Out (FIFO) : 
	- 2. Optimal Policy : 
	- 3. Least Recently Used (LRU) :
	- 4. Least Frequently
