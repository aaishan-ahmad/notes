 ### **Memory managment**
- Module of os 
- Functions of memory management
	- 1. Memory allocation
	- 2. Memory deallocation 
	- 3. Memory Protection 
- Goal of memory management 
	- 1. Maximum utilization of space (minimum memory fragmentation).
	- 2. Ability to run larger programs with limited space. (using virtul memory concept)tion

### **Memory Management Techiniques**
- Contiguous  : Entire process should be stored in main memory on consecutive Locations. 
	- There are two type of techniques
	- 1. Fixed partition
	- 2. Variable partition 
- Non-Contiguous : Entire process is not necessarily to store in main memory on consecutive locations.
	- There are also two type of techniques 
	- 1. Paging 
	-  2. Segmentation

### **Continguous Memory Management**
- Entire process should be stored on consecutive memory locations
- ### 1. Fixed partition contiguous MMT
	- The main memory is divided into fixed number of patition and each partition can be used to accommodate maximum one process 
	- Max degree of mutilprogramming(no of process) is limited by number of partitions.
	- Partition allocation policy 
		- 1. First Fit
		- 2. Best Fit 
		- 3. Worst Fit
		- 4. Next Fit ![[Pasted image 20241230140441.png]]
	- Whichever policy is used => There is a internal fragmentation(If extra space is allocated to process , more than required space. Hence wastage of that extra space is known as internal fragmentation)
	- ![[Pasted image 20241230144610.png]]
- ### 2. Variable Partition Contiguous MMT
	- Main memory is not divided into partitions initially 
	- When a new process arrives , a new partition is created of same size as process size and the process is allocated into the partition.
	- Hence no any internal fragmentation
	- ![[Pasted image 20241230150420.png]]
	- But There is a external fragmentation(If enough space is available to store a process but not consecutive hence wastage of space is known as external fragmentation).
	- The solution of external fragmentation : Compaction (Collect entire allocated processes into one side of memory , so that other side of memory can have entire free space)
	- ![[Pasted image 20241230152051.png]]
	- Compaction is costly process means its take time.
	- So variable partition contiguous suffer from external fragmentation, but not internal fragmentation.

### **Non-Contiguous Memory Management Techniques**
- Process is scattered in memory , not allocated at one area.
- Entire process is not necessarily to store in main memory on consecutive locations.
- ### 1. Paging
	- Scattered in same size of memory areas
	- Process is divided in equal size of pages
	- Physical memory(main memory) is divided in same equal size of frames
	- Pages are scattered in frames ![[Pasted image 20241231093218.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20241231093034.png]]
	- Page table is used to map a process page to a physical frame
	- Page table is also stored in main memory , in fram of pages.
	- Page table manage by OS.
	- Whenever CPU requests a specific content,
		- 1.find out content in which page
		- 2.search page table & get the frame no in which the page is stored .
		- 3.goto that frame no & get the content fram.
	- 2 time the physical memory (main memory) is accessed
		- one for page table
		- one for content 
- ### 2. Segmentation
	- Scattered in variable size of memory areas
