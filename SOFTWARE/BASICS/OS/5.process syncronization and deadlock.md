### **Types of Processes
- **1. Independent**
	- No any communication with any other processes
	- No syncronization require
- **2. Cooperating/Coordinating/Communication**.
	- Communication b/w processes 
	- Can affect other process or can be affected by other process 
	- Syncronization require.
- Need of syncronzation
	- in commnicating processes
- Problem without Syncronization
	- Inconsistency 
	- Loss of data
	- Deadlock
- **Critical Section**
	- The critical section  is a code segment where the shared variable can be accessed
	- So process have two section critical section(this section where only syncronization require) and remainder section

	- Syncronization is only required only in critical section of the process 
- **Race condition** 
	- A race consition is an undesirable situation , it occurs when the final result of conncurrent processes depends on the sequence in which the process complete their execution.
	- It occurs because of lack of syncronization. 
	- this is problem of critical section 
	- in b/w thread - example![[Pasted image 20241217144551.png]]
	- in b/w process - example![[Pasted image 20241217150103.png]]

### **Solution of Critical Section Problem**
- Requirements of critical section problem solution
	- 1. Mutual Exclusion : If one process is using critical section then other process can't use that critical section (means amongs two only one can accesses shared variable until they want after other ).
	- 2. Progress : If no any process in critical section & atleast one process wants to enter in critical section then it should be allowed. 
	- 3. Bounded waiting : Waiting of process should be bounded 
- **Solution 1 : Using Lock**
	- ![[Pasted image 20241218120021.png]]
	- This solution doesn't satisfy mutual exclusion because if a process preempted after while (lock) statement then both process can accesses C.S 
	- This solution statisfy progress
- **Solution 2 : Using Turn **
	- ![[Pasted image 20241218123223.png]]
	- This solution satisfy mutual exclusion .
	- This solution doesn't satisfy progress.
	- This solution satisfy bounded waiting 
	- 2 process will execute only in strict alternate manner.
