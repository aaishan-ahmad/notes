 ### **Types of Processes
- **1. Independent**
	- No any communication with any other processes
	- No syncronization require
- **2. Cooperating/Coordinating/Communication**.
	- Communication b/w processes 
	- Can affect other process or can be affected by other process 
	- Syncronization require.
- Need of syncronzation
	- in commnicating processes
- Problem without Syncronization
	- Inconsistency 
	- Loss of data
	- Deadlock
- **Critical Section**
	- The critical section  is a code segment where the shared variable can be accessed
	- So process have two section critical section(this section where only syncronization require) and remainder section 
	- ![[Pasted image 20241217085602.png]]
	- Syncronization is only required only in critical section of the process 
- **Race condition** 
	- A race consition is an undesirable situation , it occurs when the final result of conncurrent processes depends on the sequence in which the process complete their execution.
	- It occurs because of lack of syncronization. 
	- this is problem of critical section 
	- in b/w thread - example![[Pasted image 20241217144551.png]]
	- in b/w process - example![[Pasted image 20241217150103.png]]

### **Solution of Critical Section Problem**
- Requirements of critical section problem solution
	- 1. Mutual Exclusion : If one process is using critical section then other process can't use that critical section (means amongs two only one can accesses shared variable until they want after other ).
	- 2. Progress : If no any process in critical section & atleast one process wants to enter in critical section then it should be allowed. 
	- 3. Bounded waiting : Waiting of process should be bounded 
- **Solution 1 : Using Lock**
	- ![[Pasted image 20241218120021.png]]
	- This solution doesn't satisfy mutual exclusion because if a process preempted after while (lock) statement then both process can accesses C.S 
	- This solution statisfy progress
- **Solution 2 : Using Turn**
	- ![[Pasted image 20241218123223.png]]
	- This solution satisfy mutual exclusion .
	- This solution doesn't satisfy progress.
	- This solution satisfy bounded waiting 
	- 2 process will execute only in strict alternate manner.

- **Solution 3 : Peterson's Solution (The best Solution)** 
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219104648.png]]
	- mutual exclusion satisfy
	- progress satisy
	- bounded waiting also satisfy
- **Note** : all 3 solution are software solutions

### **Syncronization Hardware**
-  Synchronization hardware provides instruction-level support by the CPU to facilitate synchronization in concurrent systems.
- These instructions help manage critical sections to ensure mutual exclusion and prevent race conditions.
- Usually executed in kernel mode.
1. **TestAndSet()**:
	-![[Pasted image 20241219144304.png]]
	- return the current value flag and set it to true 
	- testandset is not a function . It is a **hardware-supported atomic instruction** provided by the CPU for synchronization purposes.here atomic means in the middle of the instruction you can perform preemption.
    - Atomic operation that tests and modifies a memory location.
    - Ensures that only one process can enter the critical section by setting a lock variable.
    - **Busy waiting :** p1 is runing critical section means p1 is busy and p2 runing while loop again and again for accesse p2 critical section means p2 is waiting so p2 process is busy waiting.
    - **Advantages :**
	    - Simplicity :  Easy to implement mutual exclusion.
	    - Atomic Execution : Ensures the operation is indivisible, avoiding race conditions.
    - **Disadvantages :**
		- Busy Waiting : If a process cannot enter the critical section, it keeps checking the lock variable, consuming CPU cycles.
		- Priority Inversion : A high-priority process might be waiting while a low-priority process holds the lock.
2. **Swap()**
	- ![[Pasted image 20241219153123.png]] 
    - Atomically exchanges the values of two memory locations.
    - Swap is not a function . It is a **hardware-supported atomic instruction** provided by the CPU for synchronization purposes.here atomic means in the middle of the instruction you can perform preemption.
    - Used to implement locks by swapping a lock variable with a temporary value.
    - Disadvantages :
	    - no mutual exclusion

### **Syncronization Tool**
- There are two type of tool os can use to provide syncronization.
- **1. Semaphore**
	- Semaphore is a syncronization tool, which is an interger value.
	- Interger value which can be accessed using following function only.
		- wait() / P() / Degrade() / lower () / down() : decrease semaphore value 
		- signal() / V() / Upgrade() /up() : increase semaphre value
	- both function is atomic. (atomic menans either they will complete excecution and then only you can go ahead or they are not completing execution and you are stopping them in between then there will not be any impact of the half execution , when you come back you will see like these function haven't even started ) 
		- ![[Pasted image 20241220110616.png]]
	- Types of Semaphore
		- 1. Binary Semaphore : can store only two values (0 or 1). It is used to implement the solution of critical section  problem with multiple proccess for mutual exlcution.
		- 2. Counting Semaphore : unlimed domain of values , it can be any integer. It is used to  contorl access to a resource that has multiple instances. 
	- ![[Pasted image 20241220135824.png]]
	- Characteristics  of Semaphores
		- Used to provide mutual exclusion  (binary semaphore)
		- Used to control accress to resources  (counting semaphore)
		- Solution using semaphore can lead to have deadlock
		- Soultion using semaphare cab lead to have starvation 
		- Solution using semaphare can be busy waiting solutions
		- Semaphores may lead to prioity inversion
		- Semphores are machine-independent 
- **2. Moniter**

### **Classical Problem on Syncronization**
#### Bounded Buffer Problem
- Known as producer-consumer problem also.
- Buffer is the shared resource between producer and consumers.
- ![[Pasted image 20241223123539.png]]
- **Solution**
	- Producers must block if the buffer is full
	- Consumers must block if buffer is empty 
	- Variables:
		- Mutex : Binary semaphore to take lock on buffer (mutual exvlusion). (intial , 1)
		- Full : Counting semaphore to denote the number of occupied slots in buffer.
		- Empty : Counting semaphore to denote the number of empty slots in buffer. 
		- Initilization : Mutex = 1,  initially the buffer is empty so Full = 0 and Empty = n;
	- producer()
	![[Pasted image 20241223152602.png]]
	- consumer()
	 ![[Pasted image 20241223161011.png]]
#### Reader-Writer Problem
- Consider a situation where we have a file shared between many people:
- If one of the people tries editing the file , no other person should be reading or writing at the same time , otherwise changes will not be visible to him/her
- However , if some person is reading the file , then others may read it at the same time.
- Solution :
	- If writer access the file , then all other readers and writers will be blocked
	- If any reader is reading , then other reader can read but writer will be blocked.
	- Variables:
		- mutex : Binary semaphore to provide mutal exclusion 
		- wrt : Binary semaphore to restrict reader and writes if writing is going on.
		- readcount : Integer variable , denotes number of active readers
		- Initialization  : mutex = 1 , wrt = 1 , readcount = 0 
	 - writer() 
	 ![[Pasted image 20241223173920.png]]
	- reader()
	 ![[Pasted image 20241223175106.png]]
#### Dining Philosopher Problem 
-![[Pasted image 20241224100012.png]] 
- K philosopher seated around circle table
- There is a chopstick between each philosopher
- A philosopher may eat if he can pick up the two chopstick adjacent to him 
- One chopstick may be picked up by one of its adjacent followers but not both
- Solution :
	-  ![[Pasted image 20241224100506.png]]
	- The above solution is good but , it should can lead deadlock when All philosophers simultaneously execute `wait(chopstick[i])`, picking up their left fork.
	- Some of the ways to aviod deadlock are follows
		- 1. There should be at most(k-1) philosphers on the table
		- 2. A philosopher should only be allowed to pick chopstick if both available at the same time.
		- 3. (best solution) One philosopher should pick the rigth chopstick first and then left chopstick next ; while all others wil pick the left one first then right one.

### **Operations on Resources**
- resource can be hardware or software
- 3 opertions on resources:
	- 1. Request : Process required for a resource to OS.
	- 2. Use : When OS allocates the resource to process , then the process can use it.
	- 3. Release : When use is completed then process releases the resource.

---
### **Deadlock**
- If two or more proccess are waiting for such an event which is nevr going to occur.
- ![[Pasted image 20241224105007.png]]
- Deadlock can occur only when all following conditions are satisfied:
	- **1. Mutual exclusion** : if one process using a resource , then other process can not use it.
	- **2. Hold and wait** : each deadlock process should hold atlest one resouce and should wait for one resource.
	- **3. No-preemption(resource)** : no any forcefull preemption of resources. 
	- **4. Circlular wait** : all the deadlock proccesses should wait for each other in circluar manner.

### **Recovery Form Deadlock**
- 1. Make sure that deadlock never occur. 
	- prevent the system form deadlock or avoid deadlock.
- 2. Allow deadlock, detect and recover
- 3. Pretend that there is no any deadlock. (modern os use this)
