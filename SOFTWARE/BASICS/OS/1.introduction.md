### **Operating System**
- It is a software 
- A program that act as a intermediary between user of a computer and the computer hardware.
- Act like a government
- Operating system goals
	- Execute user programs and make solving user problems easier.
	- Make computer system convenient to use.
	- Use the computer hardware in a effcient manner.

### **Computer System Structure**
Computer system can be divided into four components:
- **1. Hardware** - provides basic computing resources , such as CPU , memory , I/O devices.
- **2. OS** - Control and coordinate use of hardware among various application and users.
- **3. Application programs** - Define the ways in which the system resources are used to solve the computing probleams of the users , example web browser, video game , word processor ,           compiler , database systems.
- **4. User** - Peoples , machine ,  other computers.

### **What Operating Systems Do**
- Depends on the point of view
- Users want convenience, ease of use and good performance Don't care about resource utilization.
- But shared computer such as mainframe or minicomputer must keep all users happy Operating system is a resource allocator and control program making efficient use of HW and managing execution of user programs.
- Users of dedicate systems such as workstations have dedicated resources but frequently use shared resources from servers.
- Mobile devices like smartphones and tables are resource poor, optimized for usability and battery life , Mobile user interfaces such as touch screens, voice recognition.
- Some computers have little or no user interface, such as embedded computers in devices and automobiles, Run primarily without user intervention.

### **Services of Operating Systems
- User Interface
- Program Execution
- I/O Operation
- File-System manipulation
- Communication (Inter-coreCommunication)
- Error detection
- Resource allocation
- Accounting
- Protection & Security

### **Goals of Operating Systems**
- Convenience(user friendly)
- Efficiency
- Portability
- Realiablity
- Scalability
- Robustness

### **System Call** 
- A system call is a way for programs to interact with operating system  

---
### **Dual Mode of Operation **
- 1.User Mode  (mode bit = 1)
- 2.Kernal/System/Supervisor/Privileged Mode (mode bit = 0)

### **Types of OS**
- **1.Uni programming OS**
	- Os allows only one process to reside in main memory (RAM) apart form OS.
	- Singal process cannot keep CPU and I/O devices busy simultaneously.
	- Not a good CPU utilization.
	![[Pasted image 20241212135121.png]]
	

- **2.Multiprogramming OS**
	- Os allows multiple process to reside in main memory. 
	- Better CPU utilization than uni-programming
	- degree of multiproraming : no of running programs(process ) in main memory
	- As the degree of multiprograming increase , CPU utilization is also increase. but upto a certain limit.
	- ![[Pasted image 20241212140728.png]]
	- Types of multipragmming OS : 1.Pre-emptive  , 2.Non-pre-emptive 
	- 1.Non-Preemptive : A process runs on cpu till its wish. either process terminates , or goes for I/O operation. you cannot stop the process forcefully
	- 2.Preemptive :  A Process can  be forcefully taken out of cpu.(a process can be forcefully removed from the CPU)
- **3. Multitasking OS / Time Sharing OS**
	- Extension of multiprogramming OS in which process execute in round-robin fashion. 
	- The CPU switches between tasks rapidly, allocating a small slice of time (time slice) to each task in a round-robin or priority-based manner.
	- A multitasking operating system (OS) is an essential feature of modern computing, allowing a computer to execute multiple tasks (processes) seemingly at the same time.

- **4.Multi-tasking OS**
	- This OS allows multiple user to access single system simultaneously.
	- ![[Pasted image 20241212151536.png]]
	- windows is not a multiuser os but linux/unix is a multiuser os. 
- **5. Multi-Processor OS**
	- This os is used in computer systems with multiple CPUs.
	- Types: 1.Tightly coupled(shared-memory)  , 2.Loosely coupled(distributed system )
	- 1.Tigthly copuled (Shared-memory)
	- ![[Pasted image 20241212173200.png]]
	- 2.Lossely coupled (distributed system)
	- ![[Pasted image 20241212173314.png]]
- **6. Embedded OS**
	- An OS for embedded  computer systems.
	- design for a specific purpose , to increase functionality and reliability for achieving a specific task .
	- Ex: for A/C , Washing machine 
- **7. Real-Time OS**
	- Real time operating system (RTOS) are used in enviroment where a large number of events, mostly external to the computer system , must be accepted and processed in short time or within certain deadline.
	- Ex: OS use for rocket launcher
	- Every process has a deadline.
	- Types: 1.Hard RTOS , 2.Soft RTOS
	- 1.Hard RTOS : No any relief in OS means strict about deadline.
	- 2.Soft RTIOS : Some relaxation in OS 
- **8. Hand-held devices**
	- OS Used in hand-held devices 
	- EX: mobile , watch
