### **Operating System**
- A program that act as a intermediary between user of a computer and the computer hardware.
- Operating system goals
	- Execute user programs and make solving user problems easier.
	- Make computer system convenient to use.
	- Use the computer hardware in a effcient manner.

### **Computer System Structure**
Computer system can be divided into four components:
- **1. Hardware** - provides basic computing resources , such as CPU , memory , I/O devices.
- **2. OS** - Control and coordinate use of hardware among various application and users.
- **3. Application programs** - Define the ways in which the system resources are used to solve the computing probleams of the users , example web browser, video game , word processor ,           compiler , database systems.
- **4. User** - Peoples , machine ,  other computers.

### **What Operating Systems Do**
- Depends on the point of view
- Users want convenience, ease of use and good performance Don't care about resource utilization.
- But shared computer such as mainframe or minicomputer must keep all users happy Operating system is a resource allocator and control program making efficient use of HW and managing execution of user programs.
- Users of dedicate systems such as workstations have dedicated resources but frequently use shared resources from servers.
- Mobile devices like smartphones and tables are resource poor, optimized for usability and battery life , Mobile user interfaces such as touch screens, voice recognition.
- Some computers have little or no user interface, such as embedded computers in devices and automobiles, Run primarily without user intervention.

### **Defines Operating systems**
Terms OS covers many roles
- Because of myraid design and use of OSes
- Present in toaster through ships , spacecraft , game machines , TVs  and industrial controls systems.
- Born when fixed use computer for military became more general purpose and needed resource managment and program control.
- No universally accepted definition
- **"Everything a vendor ships when you order an operating system**" is a good approximation , but varies widely.
- "**The one program runing at all times on the computer**" is **kernel**, part of the operating system.
- Everything else is either
	- A **system program** (ships with the operating system, but not part of the kernel) , or
	- An **application program** , all programs not associated with operating system
- Today's OSes for general purpose and mobile computing also include **middleware**- a set of software frameworks that provide addition services to application developers such as databases , multimedia , graphics
