### **Operating System**
- It is a software 
- A program that act as a intermediary between user of a computer and the computer hardware.
- Act like a government
- Operating system goals
	- Execute user programs and make solving user problems easier.
	- Make computer system convenient to use.
	- Use the computer hardware in a effcient manner.

### **Computer System Structure**
Computer system can be divided into four components:
- **1. Hardware** - provides basic computing resources , such as CPU , memory , I/O devices.
- **2. OS** - Control and coordinate use of hardware among various application and users.
- **3. Application programs** - Define the ways in which the system resources are used to solve the computing probleams of the users , example web browser, video game , word processor ,           compiler , database systems.
- **4. User** - Peoples , machine ,  other computers.

### **What Operating Systems Do**
- Depends on the point of view
- Users want convenience, ease of use and good performance Don't care about resource utilization.
- But shared computer such as mainframe or minicomputer must keep all users happy Operating system is a resource allocator and control program making efficient use of HW and managing execution of user programs.
- Users of dedicate systems such as workstations have dedicated resources but frequently use shared resources from servers.
- Mobile devices like smartphones and tables are resource poor, optimized for usability and battery life , Mobile user interfaces such as touch screens, voice recognition.
- Some computers have little or no user interface, such as embedded computers in devices and automobiles, Run primarily without user intervention.

### **Services of Operating Systems
- User Interface
- Program Execution
- I/O Operation
- File-System manipulation
- Communication (Inter-coreCommunication)
- Error detection
- Resource allocation
- Accounting
- Protection & Security

### **Goals of Operating Systems**
- Convenience(user friendly)
- Efficiency
- Portability
- Realiablity
- Scalability
- Robustness

### **System Call** 
- A system call is a way for programs to interact with operating system  

---
### **Dual Mode of Operation **
- 1.User Mode  (mode bit = 1)
- 2.Kernal/System/Supervisor/Privileged Mode (mode bit = 0)
