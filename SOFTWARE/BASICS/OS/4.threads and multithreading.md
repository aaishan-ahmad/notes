### **Types of Thread
- 1. User Level Thread
	- Multithreading in user proces
	- Created without kernel intervation(knowledge) 
	- Context switching is very fast 
	- If one thread is blocked , OS blocks entire process
	- Generic and can run on any OS
	- Faster to create and manage 
- 2. Kernel Level Thread
	- Multithreading in OS(kernel) process 
	- Kernel itself is multithreaded 
	- Context switching  is slow
	- Individual thread can be blocked
	- Specific to OS
	- Slower to create and manage
