### **Thread**
- Thread is a components of process or lightweight process 
- Provide a way to improve application perfomance through parallellism
- Shared amongs thread 
	- code section 
	- Data section
	- Os resources 
	- Open file & Signals
- Uniques for each Thread 
	- Thread Id
	- Register Set 
	- Stack 
	- Program counter

- Advantges of multithreading
	- 1. Responsiveness 
	- 2. Faster Context switch
	- 3. Resource sharing
	- 4. Economy
	- 5. Communication
	- 6. Utilization of Multiprocess Architecture

### **Types of Thread
- 1. User Level Thread
	- Multithreading in user proces
	- Created without kernel intervation(knowledge) 
	- Context switching is very fast 
	- If one thread is blocked , OS blocks entire process
	- Generic and can run on any OS
	- Faster to create and manage 
- 2. Kernel Level Thread
	- Multithreading in OS(kernel) process 
	- Kernel itself is multithreaded 
	- Context switching  is slow
	- Individual thread can be blocked
	- Specific to OS
	- Slower to create and manage

### **Multithreading Model**
- User level thread will be implemented in the kernel level with how many thread 
- **1. Many-to-One Model**

- **2. One-to-One Model**
