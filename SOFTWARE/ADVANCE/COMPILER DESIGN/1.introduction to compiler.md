### **Compiler**
- Compiler is a program that converts the HLL  into machine language and also detect error.

- Types of compiler 
	- 1. Native Compiler (Same machine)
	- 2. Cross Compiler (Diff Machine)
	- 3. Source to Source Compiler  (HLL to HLL)
	- 4. Byte code Compiler (HLL to Byte code)
	- 5. Just in time Compiler (Bytecode to Machine code)

### **Phases of Compiler**
![[Pasted image 20250418151132.png]]
- **1. Lexical Analysis**
	- First phase of compiler
	- Also called linear scanning analysis
	- Scan source code left to right , character by character  and converts into tokens.
- **2. Syntax Analysis / Parser**
	- Parse tree is constructed using token.
	- Also check the expression follow the grammer or not.
- **3. Sementic Analysis**
	- Check the type mismatch in compitable operands.
	- Functions with improper arguments and undeclared variables.
- **4. Intermediate Code Generator**
	- Intermediate code genrate from sementic representation.
	- It is a machine independent code.
- **5. Code Optimization**
	- This is optional phase.
	- Remove unnecessary code line and arrange the sequence of statements.
- **6. Code Generation*
	- Final phase of of compiler.
	- produce target code as a result.
- **Symbol Table**
	- It is used to store the name of all entities in a sturcture form.
	- Determine scope of a name.
- **Error Handler**
	- Detect each error , report it to user and then make some recover strategy. eg : missing semicolone.

### **Compiler Passes**
- In a implementation of compiler , one or more phases are combined into a module called a ''pass''.
- 1. Single pass compiler 
	- All phases in one pass .
	- eg : pascal compiler
- 2. Multiple pass compiler
	- Phases divided into more than one pass.
	- eg : c++ compiler

### **Bootstraping**
- Bootstraping is widely used in the compilation development .
- Bootstraping is a process to create new compiler. It is also used to create cross compiler.
- A compiler can be characterized by three language.
	- 1. Source Language.
	- 2. Target Language.
	- 3. Implemented Language.

### **Cross Compiler**
- It is a compiler which is capable for creating executable code which ma run on other platforms also as well as which the compiler is running.

### **Finte State Machine**
- It is used to recognize patterns.
