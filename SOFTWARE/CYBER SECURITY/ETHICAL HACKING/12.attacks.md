### Attack Types and Differences

1. **Phishing vs. Vishing vs. Whaling vs. Smishing**
    
    - **Phishing:** Email-based attacks that deceive users into revealing sensitive information by posing as legitimate entities.
    - **Vishing:** Voice phishing using phone calls to trick users into providing information.
    - **Whaling:** Targeted phishing at high-profile individuals, such as executives.
    - **Smishing:** SMS-based phishing attempts to trick users via text messages.
2. **Spam vs. Spam**
    
    - The first "Spam" here may refer to **traditional spam**—unwanted messages, typically promotional.
    - The second could refer to **malicious spam** (malspam), which contains malware or phishing links.
3. **Shoulder Surfing**
    - Observing someone’s screen or keyboard to gather information like passwords or PINs.
4. **Dumpster Diving**
    
    - Physically searching trash for information like documents or discarded devices that could reveal sensitive data.
5. **Tailgating**
    - Following an authorized person into a restricted area without their permission, often exploiting human behavior.
6. **Zero Day**
    - Exploiting a vulnerability that is unknown to the vendor and unpatched.
    
1. **Social Engineering**
    
    - Manipulating individuals into revealing confidential information by exploiting human behavior.
8. **Reconnaissance**
    
    - Gathering information about a target system or network, often as the initial step in a larger attack.
9. **Impersonation**
    
    - Pretending to be a trusted individual to gain unauthorized access or information.
10. **Watering Hole Attack**
    
    - Compromising a website frequently visited by a target to deliver malware to the target’s system.
11. **Drive-by Attack**
    
    - Installing malware on a user’s system when they visit a compromised website without interaction.
12. **Typo Squatting**
    
    - Creating domain names similar to popular sites, relying on typos to lead users to malicious sites.
13. **Brute Force vs. Password Spray**
    
    - **Brute Force:** Attempting many possible passwords to crack an account.
    - **Password Spray:** Trying a few commonly used passwords on many accounts to avoid detection.

### Common Network-Based Attacks

1. **DoS vs. DDoS**
    
    - **DoS (Denial of Service):** Overloading a system with requests, causing it to become unavailable.
    - **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):** A large-scale DoS attack using multiple sources, often botnets.
2. **MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)**
    
    - Intercepting communication between two parties to eavesdrop, alter, or steal information.
3. **ARP Poisoning**
    
    - Spoofing ARP messages to associate an attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate device.
4. **Evil Twin**
    
    - Setting up a fake Wi-Fi access point that appears legitimate to steal users’ credentials or data.
5. **DNS Poisoning**
    
    - Corrupting a DNS server’s cache to redirect users to malicious websites.
6. **Rogue Access Point**
    
    - An unauthorized Wi-Fi access point set up within an organization’s network, potentially used for attacks.
7. **VLAN Hopping**
    
    - Bypassing VLAN segmentation to access restricted network segments by manipulating VLAN tagging.
8. **Death Attack**
    
    - Sending malformed packets to crash a network device or system (e.g., Ping of Death).
9. **War-driving/War-dialing**
    
    - **War-driving:** Searching for open Wi-Fi networks while driving.
    - **War-dialing:** Dialing multiple phone numbers to locate open modem connections.
10. **Buffer Overflow**
    
    - Overloading a buffer’s capacity, causing overflow and potential code execution by injecting malicious code.
11. **Memory Leak**
    
    - A program error where memory is not properly released, leading to resource exhaustion and potential service disruptions.
12. **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**
    
    - Injecting malicious scripts into websites to steal information from users or hijack their sessions.
13. **SQL Injection**
    
    - Inserting malicious SQL code into queries to manipulate databases and potentially extract sensitive data.
14. **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**
    
    - Forcing a user to execute unwanted actions on a trusted site where they are authenticated.
15. **Replay Attack**
    
    - Capturing and reusing valid data transmissions to gain unauthorized access to systems or networks.
16. **Pass the Hash**
    
    - Using captured password hashes to authenticate without knowing the plaintext password.
17. **Directory Traversal**
    
    - Manipulating file paths to access unauthorized files on a server, often escaping a web server’s root directory.
