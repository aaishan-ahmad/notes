### 1. **Antivirus**

- **Antivirus:** Software designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (malware) such as viruses, worms, and Trojans. It typically scans files, monitors system behavior, and uses signature-based detection, among other methods, to identify threats.

---

### 2. **Antimalware**

- **Antimalware:** A broader term than antivirus, antimalware software protects against all forms of malware, including viruses, ransomware, spyware, and adware. It uses various techniques like signature-based and behavior-based detection to identify and mitigate threats.

---

### 3. **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)**

- **EDR:** A security solution focused on detecting, investigating, and responding to suspicious activities on endpoints (such as computers and mobile devices). EDR continuously monitors endpoints, providing real-time insights and automated responses to potential threats.

---

### 4. **DLP (Data Loss Prevention)**

- **DLP:** A strategy and set of tools designed to prevent the unauthorized sharing or leakage of sensitive data. DLP solutions monitor, detect, and block risky actions, ensuring that sensitive information remains secure and compliant with policies.

---

### 5. **Firewall and Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW)**

- **Firewall:** A network security device or software that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules. Traditional firewalls filter data based on IP addresses, port numbers, and protocols.
- **Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW):** Combines traditional firewall capabilities with additional features such as deep packet inspection, application-level filtering, intrusion prevention, and advanced threat protection to provide more robust security.

---

### 6. **NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System)**

- **NIDS:** A security system that monitors network traffic for suspicious activities or policy violations. It analyzes packets as they traverse the network to detect possible attacks. However, it only alerts on potential threats and does not actively block them.

---

### 7. **Host-Based Firewall**

- **Host-Based Firewall:** A firewall installed on individual hosts or devices, such as personal computers or servers, to control incoming and outgoing traffic based on security policies. It provides a layer of protection against threats that may bypass the network firewall.

---

### 8. **HIPS (Host-Based Intrusion Prevention System)**

- **HIPS:** A security solution that monitors and analyzes activities on a specific host, detecting and blocking potentially malicious actions. HIPS is designed to protect individual devices by identifying anomalous behaviors and preventing known attack patterns.

---

### 9. **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)**

- **IDS:** A security tool that monitors network or system activities for malicious behavior or policy violations. IDS can be network-based (NIDS) or host-based (HIDS). It detects intrusions and generates alerts but does not actively block attacks.

---

### 10. **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)**

- **IPS:** An extension of IDS that not only detects but also prevents or blocks identified threats. IPS can automatically take action, such as blocking suspicious traffic, to protect against potential security breaches.

---

### 11. **NIPS (Network-Based Intrusion Prevention System)**

- **NIPS:** An IPS deployed at the network level to monitor and prevent suspicious or malicious traffic. It sits within the network, inspecting packets in real-time to block potential threats before they reach individual hosts.

---

### 12. **Sandboxing**

- **Sandboxing:** A security mechanism that isolates programs in a restricted environment (sandbox) to execute and analyze them safely. Sandboxing is commonly used to examine untrusted or potentially harmful files, especially in malware analysis.

---

### 13. **ACL (Access Control List)**

- **ACL:** A set of rules that define which users or devices have permission to access certain resources or services. ACLs are commonly used on network devices (like routers) to control traffic based on IP addresses, ports, or protocols.

---

### 14. **EAP vs PEAP**

- **EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol):** A framework that provides various authentication methods for securing wireless networks and point-to-point connections.
- **PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol):** An EAP method that adds a secure TLS (Transport Layer Security) tunnel, which protects EAP exchanges, making it more secure for wireless authentication.

---

### 15. **WPA vs WPA2 vs WPA3 vs WEP**

- **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy):** An older, outdated wireless security protocol with weak encryption (RC4), making it easy to crack. Itâ€™s generally not recommended.
- **WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access):** A more secure successor to WEP that improved security using TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol), but it is still vulnerable by modern standards.
- **WPA2:** An upgrade to WPA, it replaced TKIP with CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol) using AES encryption, providing stronger security.
- **WPA3:** The latest Wi-Fi security standard that includes better encryption, protection against brute-force attacks, and improved security for public Wi-Fi networks.

---

### 16. **WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)**

- **WPS:** A network security standard designed to make it easier to connect devices to a secure wireless network. However, WPS has known security vulnerabilities and is often disabled by security-conscious users.

---

### 17. **EAP vs EAP-TLS vs EAP-PEAP**

- **EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol):** An overarching framework for various network authentication methods, supporting multiple authentication protocols.
- **EAP-TLS (EAP-Transport Layer Security):** A highly secure EAP method that uses TLS for mutual authentication between client and server, requiring certificates on both ends.
- **EAP-PEAP (Protected EAP):** Similar to PEAP, this method creates a secure TLS tunnel to protect EAP traffic. It is widely used in wireless networks and typically requires a server certificate but not a client certificate.
