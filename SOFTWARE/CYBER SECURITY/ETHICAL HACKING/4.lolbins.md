living off the land 


**What are LOLBINs?**

In the real world, living off the land means surviving on what you can get directly from nature.  
This could involve:

- **Growing your own food**: This could be through farming, gardening, or raising livestock.  
- **Hunting and fishing**: Catching wild animals for food.  
- **Foraging**: Collecting edible plants, nuts, and berries.  

People who live off the land typically aim to be self-sufficient, meaning they produce most or all of what they need to survive. This can be a challenging but rewarding lifestyle.

There's also a different meaning of "living off the land" used in cybersecurity. In this context, **it refers to a type of cyberattack where hackers use legitimate tools and resources already on a computer system to carry out their attack.**

- The goal of the LOLBAS project is to document every binary, script, and library that can be used for Living Off The Land techniques.
- **Living Off The Land means**: Compromising the system **using only tools coming with the operating system**.
