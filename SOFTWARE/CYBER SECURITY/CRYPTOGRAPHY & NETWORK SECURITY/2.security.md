### CIA Triad / Security Goals
- 1.confidentiality  : we prevent unauthorised access, (achieve confidentiality by encryption)
- 2.Integrity :  sent = receive  (whatever message the sender is sending the same message only receiver should recieve ), means no modification of the message that is being transmitted if there is any modification in the mesaage then system have ability to detect and discard that message. 
- 3.Availability :  timely and  reliable access to the system.

- NOTE: addition more two key point : authenticity and accountability

### Security Services
- Data confidentiality : protect data form attacker
- Data integrity : Protecting data from modification
- Authentication : verifing actual person hai ya nahi
- non-repudiation : assurance that someone can't deny the validity of something
- Access control : to whom the access should be given can be decided 



### Security Attack
**Passive Attack**
- Passive attacks involve monitoring or gathering information from a system without affecting its resources or operations.
- The attacker aims to observe and collect data without being detected. These types of attacks are often difficult to detect because they don't involve any alteration of the system.
- We can prevent it using better encryption techniques.
- types of passive attack:
	- Release of message context : the attacker will easily be able to understand the data.
	- Traffic analysis : If we have encryption protection , an attacker right still be able to observe the pattern of these message . the attacker could determine the location and the identify of communication hosts and could observe the frequency and length of the message being exchanged.

**Active Attack**
- Active attacks involve direct interaction with a system and often attempt to alter, disrupt, or damage it.
- These attacks modify or manipulate data, services, or communications and are typically more disruptive and easier to detect than passive attacks.
- types of active attack :
	- Spoofing/ Masquerading : Masquerading as a trusted entity to gain unauthorized access or trick users, often seen in IP spoofing, email spoofing, or website spoofing.
	- Man-in-the-Middle : Intercepting and altering communications between two parties without their knowledge. 
	- Denial-of-Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) : Overloading a network or server with requests to make it unavailable to legitimate users.
	-  Replay : Involve passive capture of a message and its subsequent retrainsmission to produce an unauthorized effect .
	- SQL Injection: Injecting malicious code into a query to manipulate or steal data from a database.
	- Phishing: Deceptive attempts to trick users into providing sensitive information, often through fake emails or websites.
	- Privilege Escalation : Exploiting a vulnerability to gain higher access levels than authorized.


### Security Mechanisms
Security mechanism are used to provide security 
- Enchipherment : plain text to cipher text using mathmatical algorithm.
- DIgital Signature : It is a means by which the sender can electonically verify the signature.
- Data integrity : checksum
- Authentication exchange
- Traffic Padding : add extra bits to  confusion the attacker
- Routing control : Means selecting and continuously changing diffrent avavliable routes b/w sender and reciver
- Access control : These method prove that a user has access right to the data.
- Notarization : Selecting a third trusted party to control the communication between two entity.
