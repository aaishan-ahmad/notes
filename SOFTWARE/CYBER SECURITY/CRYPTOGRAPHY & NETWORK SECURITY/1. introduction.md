### Need for Networking Security 
- protect data from hacker


### Computer Security 
- The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preseving the **integrity , availability , and confidentiality** of information system resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications).



### Levels of Security Breach 
- LOW
- MEDIUM
- HIGH


### Threat and Attack
- Treat : A threats is a possiable danger that might be exploit a valnerability.
- Attack : An attack is a deliberate attempt by malicious actors or automated systems to exploit vulnerabilities, disrupt services, steal data, gain unauthorized access, or cause other forms of harm. Attacks can be launched against networks, devices, applications, and users and often vary in complexity, sophistication, and impact.


### The OSI Security Architecture
- Deal with three things
- Security Attack : Action that compromises the security. two type of attack [1.passive attack ], [2.active attack]
- Security Mechanism : Detect , prevent or recover from a security attack.
- Security Service : Enhance the security , counter security attacks , and provides the service.


### Why Crypthography
- 
### Crypthography
- The art of protecting information by transforming it into an unreadable format
![[Pasted image 20241113110741.png]]
- Encryption : process of transfroming information form readable to unreadable fromat. encription algorithm are used to encrypt the information/data.
- Decryption : process of transforming infromation form unreadable to readable format. decryption algorithm are used to decrypt the information/data. 
- Key : string of bits used by cryptographic algorithms to transform plain text to  cipher text or vice versa. it used for secure communication.
  - Case: Symentic cryptography : if key are same
        Asymentic crypthography : if key are different



### Types of Cryptography
**1. Symentic cryptography** : 
 - In symmetric key cryptography, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- Both the sender and receiver must know the key and keep it secret.
- It is also called secret key cryptography /private key cryptography or conventional key cryptography.
- Common algorithms: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard), 3DES (Triple DES), Blowfish.
- Use cases: Data encryption in file storage, SSL/TLS for secure internet connections.

 **2. Asymentic cryptography :** 
- It is also called public key cryptography.
- It uses two keys "a pair of keys for encryption and decryption".
- public key : known to everyone.
- private key : known only to that particular person.
- popular asymentic cryptography algorithm  RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), and DSA
- NOTE: A message that is encrypted using a public key only be decrypted using a private key, while also , a message encrypted using private key can be decrypted using public key.

**3. Hash function :**
- There is no usage of key in this concept/algorithm.
- Converts data into a fixed-length hash value, which is unique for each unique input. It’s a one-way function, meaning the original data can’t be recovered from the hash value.
- Ex algorithm :  SHA-256, MD5, and SHA-3.
- Used in password storage, data integrity verification, and digital signatures.
- many os use hash function to encrypt the passwords.
- it also called 'message digest'. 

Note: there are some other types  quantum cryptography (future of cryptography), Steganography.
