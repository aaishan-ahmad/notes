### **Object Oriented Programming**
- Solving problem by creating objects is one of the most popular approaches in programming This is called object oriented programming.
- DRY : Do not repeat yourself (focuses on code reuseablity)
---
### **Class and Obejct**
- **Class :** 
	- Class is a description of an object's property and behavour. OR 
	- A class is a blueprint for creating a object.
	- Creating class is as good as creatig data type.
	- Class is defining a category of data.
- **Obejct :** 
	- Instance of class 
	- An object is a runtime entity that is created from a class. It represents a real-world entity and contains state (attributes) and behavior (methods).
	- Object consumes memory to hold property.
- NOTE:
	- Class : Employee
	 - Attributes (Properties) : name , age salary
	- Method (behavior) : getSalary() , increment()
- EXAMPLE:
```java
//Class
class Student  
{
 //Attributes
 String name;
 int age ;
 char section;

 //Methods
 void displayDetails()
 {...}
 void addGrade()
 {  ....}

}
class Main ()
{
 main ()
 {
 //object
  Student s1 = new Student();// s1 is obejct and instance of class Student
 }
}

```

### **Constructor**
- Constrcutor is a member function of a class.
- The name of constrcutor is same as the name of the class.
- Constrcutor has no return type.
- A constructor is a special method that is used to intialize a newly created object and It is called implicitly just after the memory is allocated for the object.
- It is not mandatory for the coder to write a constructor for the class.
- When there is no constructor define in the class by programmer , compilr implicitly provide a default cosntructor for the classs.
- Constructor can be parameterized and overloaded.
```java
class A
{
//cosntructor
  A ()
  {
  }
}
```

### **Static Member**
- Static means for class.
- Static member doesn't  need obj to access it , it access by classname.
- creates one for a program.
- We can declare :
	- Static variable in class
	- Static function in class
	- Static inner class in class
	- But not static variable in function
### 1. Static variable in class
- Static variable are declared in the class using static keyword.
- Static variable are by default intilized to its default value.
- Static variable has a single copy for the whole class and does not depend on the object.
```java
class example 
{
// define
static int a;
...
}
//access
classname.staticvariablename;
eg: example.a;

```
### 2. Static function in class
- Static function defined inside the class are qualified with the keyword static.
- Static function can only access static member of the same class;
- Static function can be invoked using classname and dot operator.
```java
class example {
// define
 public static void hello { 
 ...
 }
}
// access
classname.staticfuctionname;
eg: example.hello();
```
### 3. Static class
- We can have a class inside a class which is know as inner class .
- Inner class can be qualifies with the keyword static.
```java
class hello
{
//define
 static class My
 { 
 ...
 }
}
//access
classname.innerstaticclassname;
eg:  hello.My obj = new hello.My();
```

### **OOP Core Principle**
- Note : some programming lanuage doesn't implement data hiding like python because , it is not consider as core principle
### 1. Encapsulation
### 2. Inheritance
- Use extends keyword. baseclass means superclass and derived class means subclass.
```java
class subclass extends superclass
{

}
```
- In the java programming language , each class is allowed to have one direct superclass and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclass.
- private member of the superclass are not  accessible by the subclass and can only be indirectly accessed .
- Members that have default accessibility in the superclass are also not accessible bu subclass in other package.
- **Java supports**
	- 1. Single inheritance ![[Pasted image 20250502211330.png]]
	- 2. Multilevel Inheritance![[Pasted image 20250502211414.png]]
	- 3. Hierarchical Inheritance![[Pasted image 20250502211502.png]]
### 3. Polymorphism 
- overloading method/operator(compile time) , method overriding (run time).
- **Function Overloading**
- 
###  4. Data hiding
### 5. Abstraction 

---

### **Initialization Block**
- There are two types of initilization blocks 
	- 1. Instance initialization block
	- 2. Static initilizatio block
- **1. Instance Initailization Block**
	- An instance initializer or initialization block declared in a class is executed when an instance of the class is created.
	- Return keyword cannot be used in initialization block.
	- Instance initialization are permitted to refer to the current object via the keyword this and to use the keyword super.
	- It run before the constructor.
```java 
class Test 
{
  {
  System.out.println("in initilization block");
  }
}
```
- **2. Static Initailization Block**
	- A static initializer declare in a class is excuted when the class is initialize.
	- Static initializers may be used to initialize the class variables (static) of the class.
	- Return keyword can not be used in static initialization block.
	- this or super cannot be used in static block.
```java
class Test 
{
  static 
  {
   ...
  }
}
```
---
### **Inner Class or Nested Class**
- In java , just like method , variables of a class too can have another class as its member.
- The class written within is called the nested class or inner class.
- The class that holds the inner class is called the outer class.
- **Types of inner class**
- **1. Static inner class**
	- Static inner class instance can be created outside the outer class with the following syntax : `Outer.Inner obj = new Outer.Inner();`
	- No need to create instance of outer class
```java
class Outer 
{
  int a ;
  static class Inner 
  {
    void fun ()
    { 
      System.out.println("I am fun");
    }

  }
}
class Main 
{
  public static void main (String args[])
  {
    Outer.Inner obj = new Outer.Inner();
    obj.fun();
  }
}

```
- **2. Non static inner class**
	- Non-static inner class instance can be created outside the outer class with the following syntax :`Outer objo = new Outer ();`and `Outer.Inner obji = objo.new Inner();`
	- Need to create instance of outer class
```java
class Outer 
{
  int a ;
   class Inner 
  {
    void fun ()
    { 
      System.out.println("I am fun");
    }

  }
}
class Main 
{
  public static void main (String args[])
  {
    Outer objo = new Outer();
    Outer.Inner obji = objo.new Inner();
    obji.fun(); 
  }
}

```
- **NOTE :**
	- We know a class cannot be associated with the access modifier private, but if we have the access modifier private , but if we have the class as a member of other class , then the inner class can be made private.
	- Inner class can be private  , protected , public or default

---

### **Anonymous Class**
- Anonymous classes in java are more accurately known as anonymous inner class.
- There's no such thing as anonymous classes without the `inner`.
- They are defined inside another class.
- An anonymous inner class is an inner class that is declared without using a class name. 
- An anonymous inner class always be inner class and child class.
- Because it is anonymous we need make obj Immediately and the refrence variable will of the parent class.
```java
class Greeting 
{
 public void Hello ()
 {
   System.out.println("Hello")
 }
}

public class Main 
{
  public static void main (String args[])
  {
    Greeting obj = new Greeting {...} //here we extends the class Geeting and make a anonymouse class and its obj 
    
  }
}


```
- NOTE : we can only override or access those function or which present in parent because we assign the obj in parent class refrence variable.
