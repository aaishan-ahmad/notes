### **Object Oriented Programming**
- Solving problem by creating objects is one of the most popular approaches in programming This is called object oriented programming.
- DRY : Do not repeat yourself (focuses on code reuseablity)
---
### **Class and Obejct**
- **Class :** A class is a blueprint for creating a object.
- **Obejct :** Instance of class 
	- An object is a runtime entity that is created from a class. It represents a real-world entity and contains state (attributes) and behavior (methods).
- NOTE:
	- Class : Employee
	 - Attributes (Properties) : name , age salary
	- Method (behavior) : getSalary() , increment()
- EXAMPLE:
```java
//Class
class Student  
{
 //Attributes
 String name;
 int age ;
 char section;

 //Methods
 void displayDetails()
 {...}
 void addGrade()
 {  ....}

}
class Main ()
{
 main ()
 {
 //object
  Student s1 = new Student();// s1 is obejct and instance of class Student
 }
}

```

### **Constructor**

### **OOP Core Principle**
- **1. Encapsulation**
- **2. Inheritance **// 
- **3. Polymorphism** // overloading method/operator(compile time) , method overriding (run time)
- **4. Data hiding**
- **5. Abstraction** //
Note : some programming lanuage doesn't implement data hiding like python because , it is not consider as core principle
