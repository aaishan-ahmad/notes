### **Object Oriented Programming**
- Solving problem by creating objects is one of the most popular approaches in programming This is called object oriented programming.
- DRY : Do not repeat yourself (focuses on code reuseablity)
---
### **Class and Obejct**
- **Class :** 
	- Class is a description of an object's property and behavour. OR 
	- A class is a blueprint for creating a object.
	- Creating class is as good as creatig data type.
	- Class is defining a category of data.
- **Obejct :** 
	- Instance of class 
	- An object is a runtime entity that is created from a class. It represents a real-world entity and contains state (attributes) and behavior (methods).
	- Object consumes memory to hold property.
- NOTE:
	- Class : Employee
	 - Attributes (Properties) : name , age salary
	- Method (behavior) : getSalary() , increment()
- EXAMPLE:
```java
//Class
class Student  
{
 //Attributes
 String name;
 int age ;
 char section;

 //Methods
 void displayDetails()
 {...}
 void addGrade()
 {  ....}

}
class Main ()
{
 main ()
 {
 //object
  Student s1 = new Student();// s1 is obejct and instance of class Student
 }
}

```

### **Constructor**
- Constrcutor is a member function of a class.
- The name of constrcutor is same as the name of the class.
- Constrcutor has no return type.
- A constructor is a special method that is used to intialize a newly created object and It is called implicitly just after the memory is allocated for the object.
- It is not mandatory for the coder to write a constructor for the class.
- When there is no constructor define in the class by programmer , compilr implicitly provide a default cosntructor for the classs.
- Constructor can be parameterized and overloaded.
```java
class A
{
//cosntructor
  A ()
  {
  }
}
```

---
### **Static Member**
- Static means for class.
- Static member doesn't  need obj to access it , it access by classname.
- creates one for a program.
- We can declare :
	- Static variable in class
	- Static function in class
	- Static inner class in class
	- But not static variable in function
### 1. Static variable in class
- Static variable are declared in the class using static keyword.
- Static variable are by default intilized to its default value.
- Static variable has a single copy for the whole class and does not depend on the object.
```java
class example 
{
// define
static int a;
...
}
//access
classname.staticvariablename;
eg: example.a;

```
### 2. Static function in class
- Static function defined inside the class are qualified with the keyword static.
- Static function can only access static member of the same class;
- Static function can be invoked using classname and dot operator.
```java
class example {
// define
 public static void hello { 
 ...
 }
}
// access
classname.staticfuctionname;
eg: example.hello();
```
### 3. Static class
- We can have a class inside a class which is know as inner class .
- Inner class can be qualifies with the keyword static.
```java
class hello
{
//define
 static class My
 { 
 ...
 }
}
//access
classname.innerstaticclassname;
eg:  hello.My obj = new hello.My();
```

---
### **OOP Core Principle**
- Note : some programming lanuage doesn't implement data hiding like python because , it is not consider as core principle
### 1. Encapsulation
### 2. Inheritance
- Use extends keyword. baseclass means superclass and derived class means subclass.
```java
class subclass extends superclass
{

}
```
- In the java programming language , each class is allowed to have one direct superclass and each superclass has the potential for an unlimited number of subclass.
- private member of the superclass are not  accessible by the subclass and can only be indirectly accessed .
- Members that have default accessibility in the superclass are also not accessible bu subclass in other package.
- **Java supports**
	- 1. Single inheritance ![[Pasted image 20250502211330.png]]
	- 2. Multilevel Inheritance![[Pasted image 20250502211414.png]]
	- 3. Hierarchical Inheritance![[Pasted image 20250502211502.png]]
- **Constructor in inheritance**
	- sub class's constructor invokes constructor of super.
	- Explicit call to the super class constrctor from sub class's constructor  can be made using super().
	- You write a subclass constrcutor that invokes the constructor of the super class , wither implicitly or by using the keyword super. .
### 3. Polymorphism 
- overloading method/operator(compile time) , method overriding (run time).
- **Function Overloading**
	-  If two methods of a class (whether both declared in same class or both inherited by a class , or one declared and one inherited) have the same name but signatures that are not same , then the methods name is said to be overloaded.
	- Method overloading is a way to implement polymorphism.
```java
class A 
{
 public void f1 (int x)
 { System.out.println("one number");
 }
 public void f1 (int x , int y)
 {
   System.out.println("two number");
 }
}
```
- **Function Overriding**
	- Method overriding is defining a method in subclass with the same name and signature with specific implemnetation in respect the subclass.
```java
class A 
{
 public void fun ()
 { 
  System.out.println("class A");
 }
}

class B extends A 
{

 public void fun ()
 {
  System.out.println("class B");
 }
}
```
### 4. Data hiding
### 5. Abstraction 

---
### **Initialization Block**
- There are two types of initilization blocks 
	- 1. Instance initialization block
	- 2. Static initilizatio block
- **1. Instance Initailization Block**
	- An instance initializer or initialization block declared in a class is executed when an instance of the class is created.
	- Return keyword cannot be used in initialization block.
	- Instance initialization are permitted to refer to the current object via the keyword this and to use the keyword super.
	- It run before the constructor.
```java 
class Test 
{
  {
  System.out.println("in initilization block");
  }
}
```
- **2. Static Initailization Block**
	- A static initializer declare in a class is excuted when the class is initialize.
	- Static initializers may be used to initialize the class variables (static) of the class.
	- Return keyword can not be used in static initialization block.
	- this or super cannot be used in static block.
```java
class Test 
{
  static 
  {
   ...
  }
}
```
---
### **Final Keyword**
- Where use
	- 1. final instance variable
	- 2. final static variable
	- 3. final local variable
	- 4. final class
	- 5. final method
- **1. final instance variable**
	- A java variable can be declared using the keyword final. Then the final variable can be assigned only once.
	- A variable that is declared as final and not initilized is called blank final variabe.
	- A blank final variable force either the constrcutors to initialize it or initilization block to do the job.
- **2. final static variable**
	- Static member variable when qualified with final keyword , it becomes blank until.
- **3. final local variable**
	- Local variabes that are final must be initialized before it's use , but you should remember this rule is applicable to non final local variables too.
	- Once they are initialized , can not be altered.
- **4. final class**
	- Java classes declared as final cannot be extended . Restricting inheritance.
- **5. final method**
	- Method declared as final cannot be overridden.
---
### **This Keyword**
- The this object referance is a local variable in instance member methods referring the caller object.
- this keyword is used as a reference to the current object which is an instance of the current class.
- The this reference to the current object is useful in situations where a local variable hiders or shadows a field with the same name.
- If a method needs to pass the current object to another method it can do so using the this refrence.
- Note that the this refrence cannot be used in a static context , as sattic code is not executed in the context of any object.
```java
class A
{
 int var ;
 void alter ()
 {
  this.var = 90;
 }
}
```

---
### **Super Keyword**
- In inheritance , subclass object when call as instance member function of subclass only , function contains implicit refrence variable this and super bot referring to the current object (object of subclass). but the only diffrence between this and super is 
	- this refrence variable is of subclass type.
	- super refrence variale is of superclass type.
- **Use of super keyword**
	- If your method overrides one of its superclass's methods , you can invoke the superclass version of method through the use of the keyword super.
	- It avoid name conflict between member variables of superclass and subclass.
---
### **Static Member In Inheritance**
- **Static member function :**
	- A class XYZ inherits from its direct superclass all concrete methods m (both static and instance) of the superclass.
	- No method declared in XYZ has same signature.
- **Function Hiding :**
	- If subclass has a method m with the same signature as of the method present in the superclass , then method m hides the method of superclass.
- **Notes :**
	-  1. It is a compile-time error if a static method hides an instance method.
	- 2. It is a compile-time error if an instance method overrides a static method.
---
### **Constructor Chaining**
- Constructor can call other constructors of the same class or superclass.
- constructor call form a constructor must be the first step(call should appear in the first line).
- Such series of invocation of constructors is known as construtor chaining.
- **super() or this()**
	- First line of constructor is either super or this() (by default super())
	- Constructor never cotains super() and the this() both.
---
### **Inner Class or Nested Class**
- In java , just like method , variables of a class too can have another class as its member.
- The class written within is called the nested class or inner class.
- The class that holds the inner class is called the outer class.
- **Types of inner class**
- **1. Static inner class**
	- Static inner class instance can be created outside the outer class with the following syntax : `Outer.Inner obj = new Outer.Inner();`
	- No need to create instance of outer class
```java
class Outer 
{
  int a ;
  static class Inner 
  {
    void fun ()
    { 
      System.out.println("I am fun");
    }

  }
}
class Main 
{
  public static void main (String args[])
  {
    Outer.Inner obj = new Outer.Inner();
    obj.fun();
  }
}

```
- **2. Non static inner class**
	- Non-static inner class instance can be created outside the outer class with the following syntax :`Outer objo = new Outer ();`and `Outer.Inner obji = objo.new Inner();`
	- Need to create instance of outer class
```java
class Outer 
{
  int a ;
   class Inner 
  {
    void fun ()
    { 
      System.out.println("I am fun");
    }

  }
}
class Main 
{
  public static void main (String args[])
  {
    Outer objo = new Outer();
    Outer.Inner obji = objo.new Inner();
    obji.fun(); 
  }
}

```
- **NOTE :**
	- We know a class cannot be associated with the access modifier private, but if we have the access modifier private , but if we have the class as a member of other class , then the inner class can be made private.
	- Inner class can be private  , protected , public or default

---
### **Anonymous Class**
- Anonymous classes in java are more accurately known as anonymous inner class.
- There's no such thing as anonymous classes without the `inner`.
- They are defined inside another class.
- An anonymous inner class is an inner class that is declared without using a class name. 
- An anonymous inner class always be inner class and child class.
- Because it is anonymous we need make obj Immediately and the refrence variable will of the parent class.
```java
class Greeting 
{
 public void Hello ()
 {
   System.out.println("Hello")
 }
}

public class Main 
{
  public static void main (String args[])
  {
    Greeting obj = new Greeting {...} //here we extends the class Geeting and make a anonymouse class and its obj 
    
  }
}


```
- NOTE : we can only override or access those function or which present in parent because we assign the obj in parent class refrence variable.
