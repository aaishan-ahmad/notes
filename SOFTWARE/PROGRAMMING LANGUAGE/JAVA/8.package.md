### **Package**
- Package are nothing more than the way we organize files into diffrent directories accoriding to their functionality , usability as well as category they should belong to.
- File in one directory (package)  would have different functionality form those of another directory.
- For example : file in java.io package do something related to I/O , but files in java.net package give us the ways to deal with the network 
- Package help in avoiding name confilicts
- Example : ![[Pasted image 20250302131108.png]]
- There are two types of packages:
	- 1. Built in packages : java api
	- 2. User defined packages : custom packages 
- **Example 2 :**![[in_built.png]]
- Packaging also help us to aoid class name collision when we use he same class name as that others.
- The benefits of using package reflect the ease of maintenance , organization and increase collaboration among developers.

### **Create Package**
- Suppose we have a file called HelloWorld.java , and we want to put this file in package world
```java 
package world;

public class 
{
	public static void main (String args[])
	{
	  System.out.println("Hello World");
	}

}
```
- `cmd : javac -d . HelloWorld.java` : make class file in world folder(package)
- `cmd : java word.HelloWorld` : run
---
### **Import**
- Import is a keyword in java
- It is used to import classes of other package 
- **Syntax/Example :**
```java
//import everyting from java.lang
import java.lang.*
//import String from java.lang
import java.lang.String
//use without import
s1= new java.lang.String 
```

### **Remember (Important Notes)**
- We can have only one public class in a single java file 
- Name of the file should be same as the name of public class
- In absence of public class , any class name can be given to the file name
