### **Package**
- Package are nothing more than the way we organize files into diffrent directories accoriding to their functionality , usability as well as category they should belong to.
- File in one directory (package)  would have different functionality form those of another directory.
- For example : file in java.io package do something related to I/O , but files in java.net package give us the ways to deal with the network .
- Package also help in avoiding class name collision when we use the same class name as that od others.
- The benefits of using package reflect the ease of maintenance , organization and increase collaboration among developers.
- **Example :**![[Pasted image 20250302131108.png]]
- **There are two types of packages**
	- 1. Built in packages : java api
	- 2. User defined packages : custom packages 
- **Example 2 :**![[in_built.png]]
- Packaging also help us to aoid class name collision when we use he same class name as that others.
- The benefits of using package reflect the ease of maintenance , organization and increase collaboration among developers.

### **Create Package**
- Suppose we have a file called HelloWorld.java , and we want to put this file in package world
```java 
package world;

public class 
{
	public static void main (String args[])
	{
	  System.out.println("Hello World");
	}

}
```
- `cmd : javac -d . HelloWorld.java` : make class file in world folder(package)
- `cmd : java word.HelloWorld` : run
---
### **Import**
- Import is a keyword in java
- It is used to import classes of other package 
- **Syntax/Example :**
```java
//import everyting from java.lang
import java.lang.*
//import String from java.lang
import java.lang.String
//use without import
s1= new java.lang.String 
```

---
### **Remember (Important Notes)**
- We can have only one public class in a single java file 
- Name of the file should be same as the name of public class
- In absence of public class , any class name can be given to the file name  
---
### **Access Modifiers**
- Java supports four categoriesof asscessibility rules.
	- Private
	- Protected 
	- Public
	- Default
- Modifiers can be used for class , member variables and member functions.
---
### **Access Modifiers With Class**
- Outer class and inner class
- For outer class , there can be only two possibility , either class is a public or just  a class which means it is of default type.
- For inner class any among four access modifiers can be used.
---
### **With Member Variable and Member Function**
- **Private  :** When member of the class are private they can't be accessed from outside the class body. They are meant to be accessed form the same class in which they are declared.
- **Protected :** When member are protected they can be accessed from any child of the same classs from other package.
- **Public :** When members are public they are accessible from any class of any package.
- **Default :** When member are default they are accessible only form the class of same package.
