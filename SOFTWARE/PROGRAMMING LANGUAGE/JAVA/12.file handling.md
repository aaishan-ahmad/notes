### **Java.io**
- The java.io package conatains nearly every class you might ever need to perform input and output (I/O) in java.
- All these streams represent an input source and an output destination.
- Java provides stronge but flexible support for I/O related to Files.
---
### **Java File Handling**
- FIle handling is an integral part of nearly all programming projects.
- File provide the means by which a program store data.

---
### **Streams**
- Streams reprsents a source (which generates the data in the form of stream) and a desination (which consumes or read data avaliable as stream).
- Stream supports a huge rae of source and sedtination including disk file , arrays , other devices , other programmes etc.
----
### **Types Of Stream**
- Modern versions of java define two types of streams : byte and character.
- Byte streams provide a convventient means for handling and output of bytes.
- Character streams are designed for handling the input and output of character.
----
### **Character Stream Classes**
- BufferedReader
- BufferedWriter 
- CharArrayReader
- CharArrayWriter
- FileReader
- FileWriter
- InputStreamReader
- OutputStreamWriter
- PrintWriter
- StringReader
- StringWriter
----
### **File Class**
- An abstract representation of file and directory pathnames.
- This class represent file meta data.
```java
import java.io.File;
File f = new File("File path");
System.out.println(f.exists());
```
- **Method of File class**
	- cretaeNewFile: for file is exist
	- exists : check file is exist
	- getName : return file name
	- length : check length of file 
	- canWrite : can file read
	- delete : delete the file
----
### **Write  to file**
- Writing data to file means storing data in the file.
- Using : FileOutputStream class.
- **FileOutputStream**
	- FileOutputStream is meant for writing streams of row bytes.
	- FileOutputStream is subclass of OutputStream.
	- **Costructor :** 
		- 1. FileOutputStream(File file) : Create a file output stream to write to the file represented by the specified File object.
		- 2. FileOutputStream(File file , boolean append) : Create a file output stream to write to the file represented by the specified FIle object.
		- 3. FileOutputStream (String path) : Create a file ouput stream to write to the file with the specified name.
		- 4. FileOutputStream (String path , boolean append ) : Creates a file output stream to write to the file with the specified name. 
	- **Method :**
		- f.write(char ch);
		- f.close();
- **Example :**
```java
File f = new File ("path");
FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(f,true);
fout.write('h');
fout.close();
```
---
### **Reading From File**
- Reading data form file means extracting data stored in the file without deleting it from the file).
- Using : FileInputStream class
- **FileInputStream**
	- FileInputStream is meant for reading streams a raw bytes.
	- A FileInputStream obtains input bytes from a file in a file system.
	- **Constructor :**
		- 1. FileInputStream(FIle file) : Creates a FileInputStream by opening a connection to a actual file , the file named by the File object file in the file systems.
		- 2. FileInputStream(String path) : Creates a FileInputStream  by opening a connection to an actual file , the file named by the path name in the file systems.
	- **Methods :**
		- read() : return unicode of character. 

---
### **Writing to a file using BufferWriter**
![[Pasted image 20250425153213.png]]
- Writes text to a character-output stream , buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient writing of single character , arrays and strings.
- The buffer size may be specified , or the default size may be accepted . The default is large enough for most purposes.
- **BufferWriter**
	- **Constructor :**
		- 1. BufferedWriter(Writer out) : Creates a buffered character-output stream that uses a default-sized output buffer.
		- 2. BufferWriter(Writer out , int sz) : Creates a new buffered character-output stream that uses an output buffer on the given size. 
- **Example**
```java 
  public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {
        BufferedWriter b = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("my.txt", true));
        b.write("computer hello");
        b.close();
    }
```
### **Reading from a file using BufferReader**
- Reads text form a character-input stream , buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters , arrays , and lines.
- The buffer size may be specified , or the default size may be used.
- **BufferReader**
	- **Constructor :**
		- BufferedReader(Reader in) : Creates a buffering character-input stream that uses a default-sized input buffer.
		- BufferedReader(Reader in , int sz) : Creates a buffering character-input stream that uses an input buffer of the specified size.
	- **Methods :**
		- read() : read and retun a character. 
		- readLine() : read a line of text. 
		- int read(char \[]cbuf , int off ,int len) : read file len size character and store into cbuf char array from the index off.

- **Example**
```java
 public static void main(String args[]) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader b = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("my.txt"));
        int ch;
        while ((ch = b.read()) != -1) {
            System.out.print((char) ch);
        }
    }
```
