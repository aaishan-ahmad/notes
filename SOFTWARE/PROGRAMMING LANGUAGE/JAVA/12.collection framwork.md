### **Collection framework**
- The Java collections framework provides a set of interfaces and classes to implement various data structures and algorithms.
- For example, the LinkedList class of the collections framework provides the implementation of the doubly-linked list data structure.

### **Collection Framework Contains The Following**
- **Interfaces**
	- These are abstract types that represent collection
- **Implementation (class)**
	- These are the concrete  implementations of the collection interfaces.
- **Algorithms**
	- These are the methods that perform useful computations , such as searching and sorting , on objects that implements collection interfaces. 

### **Describe Interfaces**
- Collection 
	- For group of objects
- List
	- Duplicates allowed
	- Insertion order is preserved
	- ArrayList , LinkedList , Vector , Stack are the implementation classes 
- Set 
	- A collection that cannot contain duplicate elements
	- Insertion order is not preserved
	- HashSet , LinkedHashSet are the classes implemented Set interface
- SortedSet 
	- Child interface of Set
	- Cannot contain duplicate elements .
	- Some sorted order
- NavigableSet
	- Child interface of SortedSet
	- It defines several methods for navigation purposes
	- TreeSet is implementation class
- Queue
	- Child interface of Collection 
	- PriorityQueue , BlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue , PriorityBlockingQueue
- Map
	- It is used to represent group of objects as key-value pairs 
	- Map is not a child interface of Collection 
	- key and values both are objects
	- Keys must be unique but value can repeat
	- HashMap , LinkedHashMap , WeakHashMap , IdentityHashMap , HashTable , Properties 
- SortedMap
	- It is used ro represent group of object as key-value pairs
	- Child interface of Map
	- Some sorting order

### **Collection and Collections**
- Collection is an interface
- Collections is a class
	- It is utility class 
	- Collections class provides several utility method like sort()

### **Methods of Collection**
- **boolean add ( Object o ) :** Add an object to the collection. 
- **boolean addAll( Collection c ) :** Add all the objects of specified collection.
- **boolean remove ( Object o ) :** Remove a single instance of the specified element from this collection.
- **boolean removeAll ( Collection c ) :** Removes all of this collection's elements that are also contained in the specified collection
- **boolean retainAll ( Collection c ) :** Retain only the elements in this collection that are contained in the specified collection
- **int Size() :** Return the number of elements in this collection.
- **boolean contains ( Object o ) :**  Return true if this collection contains the specified object.
- **void clear() :** Removes all of the elements form this collection
- **boolean isEmpty() :** Return true if this collection contains no elements.
- **Iterator \<E>  iterator() :** Returns an iterator over the elements in this collection

### **Method of List Interface**
- List interface contain all the method that has in collection interface because list interface extends collection. but some additional 
- **void add ( int index , E element) :** Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list (elements may shift).
- **E set ( int index , E element ) :** Replaces the element at specified position in this list with the specified element.
- **E get ( int index ) :** Retrun the element at specified position in this list.
- **int indexOf ( Object o ) :** Return the index of the first occurrence of specified element in  list , or -1 if this list does not contain the element.
- **int lastIndexOf ( Object o ) :** Return the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in list , or -1 if this list does not contain the element.
- **E remove ( int index ) :** Removes the element at specified position in this list.
- **List \<E> subList ( int formIndex , int toIndex ) :** Return a view of the portion of this list between the specified formIndex , inclusive , and toIndex , exclusive.

---
### **ArrayList** 
- ArrayList is defined using dynamic arrays.
- Therefore it is resizeable.
- Duplicates are allowed.
- Order of elements are preserved.
- Null insertion is possible 
- Heterogenous object are allowed 
- Memory location in sequence
- ArrayList : Constructor
	- **ArrayList a = new ArrayList () ;** => Creates an empty ArrayList object with default intial capacity "10" if ArrayList reaches its max capacity then a new ArrayList object will be created with. full => New capacity = (current capacity * 3/2 ) + 1.
	- **ArrayList a = new ArrayList (int initialcapacity);** =>Creates an empty ArrayList with specified initial capacity.
	- **ArrayList a = new ArrayList ( Collection c );** => Creates an equivalent ArrayList object for the given Collection 
- All class of collection framework Except TreeSet and TreeMap Hetrogenous objects are allowed 
---
### **LinkedList**
- LinkeList class is doubly linkedlist data structure
- LinkedList implements List so all method of list has in LikedList + 
- Methods of LinkedList
	- void addFirst ( Objetct o ) 
	- void addLast ( Object o )
	- Object getFirst()
	- Object getLast()
	- Object removeFirst()
	- Object removeLast()
- Constructor in LinkedList
	- LinkedList()
	- LinkedList( Collection c )

---
### **Vector**
- Vector is implementation class of List interface
- Dynamic Array is used to implement Vector
- Duplicates are allowed 
- Insertion order is preserved
- Null insertion is allowed
- Heterogenous are allowed
- Methods are synchronized so thread safe
---
### **ArrayList Vs Vector**
- ArrayList is not thread safe but Vector is thread safe
- ArrayList methods are non synchronized but Vector method are synchronized
- ArrayList High performance than Vector
- ArrayList first introduced in version 1.2 and Vector in version 1.0 and reengineered in version 1.2. 
---
### **Stack**
- Child class of Vector
- Last in First Out principle
- Some important methdos
	- pop()
	- push()
	- peek()
	- search()
- There is only one constructor , which creates an empty stack
	- stack() 


---
### **Cursors**
- Cursors are used to retrieve data form collection object , one by one
- There are three cursors in java
![[Pasted image 20250308102714.png]]
- **1. Enumeration :**
	- Enumeration is an interface in java.
	- Enumeration introduced in version 1.0 , thus only avaliable for legacy classes (like Vector or Stack).
	- An object that implements the Enumeration interface generates a series of elements , one at a time
	- Succesive calls to the nextElement method return succesive elements of the series![[Pasted image 20250307140038.png]]![[Pasted image 20250307142842.png]]
- **2. Iterator :**
	- Iterator is a interface in java. 
	- Iterator is available for all collection implemented class
	- All collection implemented classes provide method called iterator() : public Iterator iterator()![[Pasted image 20250307143638.png]]![[Pasted image 20250308093423.png]]
	- Limitation 
		- Enumeration and Iterator , both can move in single direction cursors.
		- Only read and remove operations are avaliable (remove only in Iterator).
		- Not able to add new object and replace any element  
- **3. ListIterator**
	- ListIterator is child interface of Iterator
	- ListIterator is bidirectional cursor
	- All List implemented classes provide a method called listIterator() : public ListIterator  listIterator().![[Pasted image 20250308213819.png]]![[Pasted image 20250308213931.png]]

### **Set**
- Set is a child interface of Collection interface
- Duplicates are not allowed 
- Insertion order is not preserve
- Set interface does not conatin any new method
---
### **HashSet**
- Hash Table is the data structure 
- If you try to insert duplicate object , add method simple return false , as duplicates are not allowed.
- Insertion order is not preserved but all object are inserted based on hash code.
- Heterogenous objects are allowed 
- Null values are allowed 
- Provide efficient searching
- Constructor 
	- HashSet() : default capacity 16 , After 75% HashSet is filled , it grows dynamically thus fill ratio or load factor is 0.75
	- HashSet( int capacity ): load factor is 0.75
	- HashSet (int capacity , float loadFactor )
	- HashSet( Collection c )
---
### **LinkedHashSet**
- Child class of HashSet.
- Insertion order is preserved unlike HashSet.
- Hash Table and Doubly Linked list both are used (hybrid DS).
- Constructor 
	- LinkedHashSet() : Default initial capacity 16 , load factor 0.75
	- LinkedHashSet (int capacity)
	- LinkedHashSet (int capacity , float loadFactor )
	- LinkedHashSet (Collection c)

---
### **SortedSet**
- SortedSet is a child interface of Set interface
- Diplicates are not allowed 
- Elements are in sorted order
- The main diffrence between Set and SortedSet is :
	- In Set , order is not important
	- In SortedSet , order is important (Some logical order)
- SortedSet interface introduces 6 new methods
	- first() : Returns the first element of the set
	- last() : Returns the last element of the set
	- headSet( E toElement) : Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are strictly less than toElement.
	- tailSet(E fromElement) : Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are greater than or equal to fromElement
	- subSet( E formElement , E toElement) : Retuns a view of the portion of this set whose elements range form fromElement , inclusive to toElement , exclusive
	- comparator () : Returns the comparator used to order the elements in this set , or null if this set uses the natural ordering of its elements
---
### **NavigableSet**
- Child interface of SortedSet.
- Provide methods for navigation in sorted list of elements
	- ceiling (E e) : Returns the least element in this set greater than or equal to the given element , or null if there is no such element .
	- floor (E e ) : Returns the greatest element in the set less than or equal to the given element , or null if there is no such element
	- higher (E e) : Returns the least element in this set strictly greater than the given element , or null if there is no such element.
	- lower (E e) : Returns the greatest element in this set strictly less than the given element , or null if there is no such element
	- pollFirst(): Return and removes  the first (lowest) element , or return null if this set is empty.
	- pollLast () : Return and removes the last (highest) element , or returns null if this set is empty.
