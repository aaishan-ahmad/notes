### **Resulting data type after ari thmetic operation**
b = byte , s = short , i = int , l = long , f = float , d = double , c = character
- R = b + s => int 
- R = s + i  => int 
- R = i + f  => float
- R = f + l  => float
- R = c + i  => int
- R = c + s => int 
- R = l + d  => double
- R = f + d => double
- **NOTE  :** increments, decrement operation remains data type same
