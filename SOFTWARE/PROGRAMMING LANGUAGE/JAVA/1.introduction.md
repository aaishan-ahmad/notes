### **What is java ?**
- Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation). It is known for its "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) approach.
- Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming language and a platform.
- Java is one of the most used language for android development, web development, artificial intelligence, cloud application and many more. 
- Purely object oriented.
- Key features
	->robutness
	->platform independent
	->secure
	->Automatic memory managmrnt
	->Many libararies and framework

### **History**.
- The java devloped by james golsing under the sun microsystem but also mike sheridon and patricks naughton was part of the development.
- first name of java was oak(1991) , oak is a tree.
- Any reason the name oak to change into java , java is name of a seed of coffee.
- java selled by sun microsystem to oracle in 2010. (7.4 billion $)
- first relased in 1995.
- **Java have three edition **
	- 1.java SE (Standard edition)  -> use for basic programing it is also called core java
	- 2.java EE (Enterprise edition)-> use for Advance programing it is also called Advance java
	- 3.java ME (Micro edition)     -> use for mobile programing but it is not related to android programing
- **JAVA Feauture**
	->simple
	->secure 
	->object oriented 
	->independent
	->portable
	->robust
	->interpreted
	->multi-thereaded
	-> Garbage collector
	->High performace
	->Distributed

### **Java is Everywhere**
- Java resides in mobiles , client machines , server machines , embedded devices , smart phone , cloud etc.
- It shares the same basic features of the language and libraries.
- Principle of java : "Write Once Run Anywhere (WORA)" .

### **What is library**
- Java library is a collection of predefined classes.
- You can use these classes either by inheritance them or by Insertantiating them.

### **Setup**
- **JDK**
	- jdk stands for java devlopment kit.
	- jdk provides all the tools to work with java language eg : compiler (javac.exe) , application launcher(java.exe) . 
	- it internally contains jre and jvm.
- **JRE**
	- jre stands for java runtime environment.
	- its provides an environment to execute the java program.
	- it internally contains jvm and contains java package classes ( java library).
- **JVM**
	- jvm stands for java virtual machine.
	- it is softwere in the form of intepreter written in c language.
	- which is resposive to execute a program.
	- Jvm is platform dependent.
	- The JVM provides a platform-independent way of executin code.
	- Java virtual machine interprests the byte code into the machine code depending upon the underlying oprating system and hardware combination.
- **Setup for compile and run**
	- step 1 - download jdk with .exe extension
	- intall the jdk and set path for jdk
	-  set variable - JAVA_HOME 
       value - c:\program File\java\jdk-19
	- set path - c:Program File\java\jdk-19\bin
- **COMPILE**
	- cmd:javac new.java
    - new.java converter into new.class
- **RUN**
	- cmd : java new
      new.class file executing via interpreter (in jvm)

### **How java work**
- Java is compiled into the bytecode and then it is interpreted to machine code ![[Pasted image 20250107205350.png]]

### **First Program**
```java
package com.Company; // Groups Classes
public class Hello 
{
public static void main (String args[])
 {
  System.out.println("Hello World");

 }
}
```
---
### **Naming Convention for Java**
- **For classes** : we use PascalConvention. means first and subsequnet characters from a word are capital letter (Uppercase) . EX : Main , MyEmpolyee , CodeWithHarry
- **For function and variables** : we use camelCaseConvention . here first character is lowercase and the subsequent characters are uppercase. EX : main , myMarks , codeWithHarry.

### **Comment**
- // -> Single Line
- /* \*/  -> Multi Line
- /** .. \*/ -> Multi Line with use for documentation 
---
### **Encoding:**
A way of representing a character as a sequence of bytes. There are several Unicode encodings, including UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.

unicode:
->Unicode is a character encoding standard that aims to represent every character in every language in a standardized way.
-> It assigns each character a unique code point, which is a numerical value that represents the character, This includes letters, numbers, symbols, and even emojis.
->Unicode helps ensure that characters are displayed correctly across different devices, operating systems, and languages.

Code point: A number assigned to a character in Unicode. This number can range from 0 to 1,114,111 (in the latest version of Unicode).
