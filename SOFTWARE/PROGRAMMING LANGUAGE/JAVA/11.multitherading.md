### **Thread**
- A thread is an independent path of execution within a program
- Many thread can run concurrently within a program
- Multithreading refers to two or more tasks executing within a single program
- Every thread in java is created and controlled by the java.lang.Thread class

### **Creating Thread**
- **There are two ways to create thread in java**
	- 1. Implement the Runnable interface (java.lang.Runnable)
	```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.start();  // Starts the thread
    }
}

```
	- 2. By extending the Thread class (java.lang.Thread)
	```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t1.start();
    }
}

```

- **When Use Runnable Interface**
	- 1. When you need to extend another class : Java does not support multiple inheritance, so if your class already extends another class, you **must** use Runnable.
	- 2. Better Resource Management (Thread Pooling) : When using **thread pools** (e.g., in Executor Framework), `Runnable` is required because it **doesn’t create unnecessary Thread objects**.This allows efficient thread reuse instead of creating new threads every time.
	- 3. More Flexibility and Reusability : `Runnable`-based tasks can be **executed by multiple threads**.If we had extended `Thread`, each thread would require a **new instance**, leading to unnecessary object creation.
- **When Use Thread Class**
	- 1. You are creating a simple, self-contained thread that **won't be reused**.
	- 2. You don’t need to extend another class.
	- 3. You want to override methods like `start()`, `interrupt()`, etc.

### **Multithreading**
- **Multithreading** allows multiple threads to run concurrently, sharing resources but executing independently.
```java
class Task1 extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Task 1 - " + i);
        }
    }
}

class Task2 extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Task 2 - " + i);
        }
    }
}

public class MultiThreadDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Task1 t1 = new Task1();
        Task2 t2 = new Task2();

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}

```

---
### **Thread State**
A thread can be in one of the following states:
1. **New** – Created but not started (`new Thread()`).
2. **Runnable** – Ready to run, waiting for CPU (`start()`).
3. **Blocked** – Waiting for a lock.
4. **Waiting** – Indefinitely waiting (`wait()`).
5. **Timed Waiting** – Waiting for a specific time (`sleep(time)`).
6. **Terminated** – Completed execution.

---
### **Thread Synchoronization**
- When multiple threads access shared resources, **synchronization** prevents race conditions.
```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() { // Synchronized method
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

public class SyncDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter counter = new Counter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
                counter.increment();
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Final Count: " + counter.getCount());
    }
}

```

### **Thread Pools (Exector Framework)**
- Why Use a Thread Pool? : When a new thread is created for each task, it consumes significant system resources. Instead, **thread pools** manage a fixed number of reusable threads, improving efficiency and performance.
- Creating a Thread Pool : Java provides the **Executor Framework (`java.util.concurrent.Executors`)** to manage thread pools.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

class Task implements Runnable {
    private int taskId;

    public Task(int taskId) {
        this.taskId = taskId;
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Executing Task " + taskId + " on Thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulating work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3); // Thread pool of size 3

        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            executor.execute(new Task(i)); // Submit tasks to thread pool
        }

        executor.shutdown(); // Prevents new tasks from being accepted
    }
}

```
- **Types of Thread Pools**
	- 1. Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n) → Fixed number of threads
	- 2. `Executors.newCachedThreadPool()` → **Creates new threads as needed, reusing old ones**
	- 3. `Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()` → **Single-threaded execution (queue-like behavior)**
	- 4. `Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(n)` → **For scheduled and periodic tasks**

---
###  **Callable and Future (Returning Values from Threads)**
- Unlike `Runnable`, which does not return results, `Callable<T>` allows **threads to return results** and **throw exceptions**.

---
### **CompletableFuture (Advanced Async Programming)**
- If you don’t want `Future.get()` to block execution, use `CompletableFuture`.

## **Summary**

|Feature|`Runnable`|`Callable<T>`|`Future`|`CompletableFuture`|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Returns a value?**|❌ No|✅ Yes (`T`)|✅ Yes (`T`)|✅ Yes (`T`)|
|**Throws Exceptions?**|❌ No|✅ Yes|✅ Yes|✅ Yes|
|**Blocking?**|❌ No|❌ No|✅ Yes (`get()`)|❌ No (Async)|
|**Non-blocking chaining?**|❌ No|❌ No|❌ No|✅ Yes (`thenApply()`)|

- **Use `Thread`/`Runnable`** for **simple background tasks**.
- **Use `ExecutorService` (Thread Pools)** for **efficient multithreading**.
- **Use `Callable` & `Future`** when **returning results from threads**.
- **Use `CompletableFuture`** for **asynchronous, non-blocking programming**.

### **Some more advance topic you need to learn later**
 - `CountDownLatch` → **Wait for multiple threads before proceeding**
- `Semaphore` → **Limit access to shared resources**
- `CyclicBarrier` → **Sync threads at a checkpoint**
- `ForkJoinPool` → **Divide and conquer parallel processing**
