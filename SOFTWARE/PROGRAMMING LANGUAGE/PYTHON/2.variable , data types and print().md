- variable is the name given to a memory location in a program.
- variable are used to hold data during execution of the program.

- In c, c++ you need to declare variables only after decularation you can use them.
- In python you don't declare variables .if there is a need of a variable you think of a name and start using it as a variable.
```python
a = 18         # a is a variable and 18 is value assign to a .
str = "hello"  # str is a variable and hello is value assign to str
```
- python is a dynamically typed programming language , means no need to specify data type before the use of variable and data type assign during execution time not compile time.
- Not only the value of a variable may change during proram execution but type as well.
- **Rules for naming of variable/identifiers
