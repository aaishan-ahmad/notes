### **Object Oriented Programming**
- It is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects.
- Python supports object oriented approach programming.
- This approach revolves around object.
- An object is a group of properties
- Object is also capable to perform certain action . such actions may change the state of an object.
- Object : Object is a real world entity.
**main aspects of oops**
- 1. Encapsulation : act of combine property and methods related to the same entity
- 2. Abstraction
- 3. Inheritance 
- 4. Polymorphism
- 5. Data hiding (not for python / for c++)

### **Class and Object**
- Class = common noun (human , city) , Object = proper noun (ramesh , delhi)
```python
class class_name:  # define class
 #variable/property 
 #function/method 

obj=class_name() #create object 


```
- In python class property and method called attribute.
**Class Object**
- class object = class name 
-  class name contain reference of class object
- class object only one and created when define class
**Instance Object**
- instance object = object of the class , 
- instance object can create many , after the class define
- instance object are empty object at the time of creating.
**\_\_init\_\_()  method**
