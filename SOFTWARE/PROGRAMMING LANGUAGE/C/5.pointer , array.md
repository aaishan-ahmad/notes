### **Pointer**
- A pointer is also a variable which store address/refrence of another variable.
- we also need to define type of pointer because the pointer need to know they store which type of value's .
```c
int a =10;
int *p;
p = &a;
// p = address of a 
//*p = value of a.= value at address p
```

### **Pointer Arthmetic**
Operation allowed on pointers:
- increment/decrement of a pointer
- Addition of integer to a pointer
- Subtraction of integer to a pointer
- Subtracting two pointer of the same type 
- Comparison of pointer of the same type

---
### **Array**
- Collection of similar datatype elements.
- Characteristics
	- All elements stored on consecutive memory locations.
	- All elements can be accessed using a set of indexes
- Declaration
```c
int arr[5]; // not intilization so contian garbaze value
int arr2[6] ={1,2,3,4,5,6};
int arr3[4] = {1,2}; //size 4 but initialize only 2 value so rest elemtent will 0
char ch[4] = {'h','r'};
int arr5[] ={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}; // automatically size of array implicity taken 
printf("%d",arr2[0]); // Accessig the first element 
```
- Base address : first element/ 0th index element of the array called base address
- Address of element arr\[i] = base address + size * i. 
- arr\[i] = i \[arr] = \*\(arr + i) =  \*( i + arr) 
- arr = base address of array arr[] = address of first element of array  = &arr\[0]
- arr + i = base address + size of element  * i
- &arr = address of whole array 
- &arr + i = base address + (size of element * total no of element ) * i. 

### **2D Array**
- Collections of 1-D arrays.
- Declaration :
	- data_type name \[size1] \[size2] ;
	- here size1 = no of 1-D array = no of row
	- size2 = no of elements in each 1-D array = no of column

- c follows row-major order
- Address of A\[i]\[j] = base + size of each element (i * n +j ) where n  = no of row
