### **Literal**
- Literals are the constant values assigned to the constant value
- define 
	- 1. using const keyword : const int a = 78;
	- 2. using macro : \#define name value 
		- macro declared on the top of program, along with header file inclusion statment , outside all functions
		- no data type needed 
		- no = 
		- no semicolon
		- Before compillation start macro name replace by value in entire program where we used it. so it is also called preprocessor.  (preprocessor directive)
		- ex:
		```c
		#include <stdio.h>
		#define pi 3.14
		#define x 2
		#define CHOICE 'y'
		```


### **Preprocessor directive** 
- All statement which start with # in c-langauge are known as preprocessing statement . and All such statement run before compilation start  
- \# is a preprocessor directive in c . 

### **Macro for function**
```c
#defien area(a,b) a*b

```
- when ever you call funcion area(5,6)  in the code replace by 5*6
