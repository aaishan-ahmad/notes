### **Function**
- A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
- function 
	-  declaration : announcement  
	- defination :  code 
	- call : execute
```c
//function declaration
void add (int, int);

//funciton defination
void add(int a , int b)
{

int sum = a+b;

printf("sum = %d",sum);
}

void main()
{
//function call
add (9,78);

}

```

- call
	- by value : pass argument is value
	- by refrence - using aliasing(new name)  not use or now not supported by most of the compiler
	- by address : pass argument is address

### **Global vs Local Variables
```c
int x = 50; // global variable
main ()
{
int x =90; // local variable
}
```

### **Storage Class\[auto,extern,register,static]**
- **1.auto**
	- local (auto) 
		- local variable is automatically auto type.
		- int  a ;// = auto int a;
		- Lifetime : during function  or block of code 
		- Scope : within function or block of code 
		- Initialization(default value) : garbage value
		- Location of storage  : stack
		 - ![[Pasted image 20241227182758.png]]
	- global (auto)
		- global variable automatically auto type
		-  int a ; // = auto int a 
		- Lifetime : during program  
		- Scope : entire program
		- Intilization (default) : with zero
		- Location of Storage : data section 
- **2. register**
	- local variable 
	- register int a ; 
	- Lifetime : during function or block of code
	- Scope : funciton or block of code 
	- Initilization (defalut) :garbage value
	- Location of storage : Cpu register (genral purpose) or stack (not cpu register not available)
	- Note : auto and register variable also called automatic variables 	
- **3. static**
	- local or global 
	- static int a ;
	- Lifetime : during the program 
	- Scope : during function /block of code (for local) and during program (for global)
	- Initilization (default value): zero
	- Location for storage : data section 
- **4. extern**
	- global 
	- it is way to represent that i am using other program global variable.
	- Lifetime : during program 
	- Scope: during program 
	- Initilization (defalut value) : zero
	- Location for storage : data section

### **Activation Record**
- An avtivation record is a data structure that is activate/created when a procedure/function is invoked , and it includes the following data about the function. stored in stack . once function call is completed ,function's activation record is removed from stack.
- Activation Record in 'C' language consist of
	- Actual Parameter 
	- Number of arguments 
	- Return address
	- Return value
	- Old stack pointer (sp)
	- Local Data in function or procedure
- Current running function is allowed to acced only it's own activation record hence local variable have scope within function.
- Even if function call itself
