### **Dynamic memory allocation**
- Dynamic memory allocation is when an executing program requests for a  block of main memory 
- allocation happen in heap
- **malloc() :** memory allocation 
	-  used to dynamically allocate a single large block of main memory with the specified size 
	- it return a pointer of type void  which should be  type casted into required type
	- if space is insufficient , allocation fails and return NULL pointer
	- it doesn't initialize memory  , hence grabage value is there 
	- pointer = (cast-type \*) malloc (size in bytes)
	-  int \*a = (int \*)malloc(4);
- **calloc() :** contiguous allocation
	- Used to dynamically allocate the specified number of block of memory of specified type 
	- It return a pointer of type void  which should be type-casted into required type
	- if space is insufficient , allocation  fails and return NULL pointer
	- It initilize memory with 0
	- pointer (cast \*) calloc (n ,element_size \_in_bytes)
- **free()**
	- Used to deallocate dynamically allocated spaces
	- free (pointer)
	- free(p) ,  then p become danngling pointer : A pointer which points a location which doesn't exist; so use p = NULL;
