### **Structure**
- Collection of diffrent datatype element
- It is a user define data type and memory is allocated only when a variable is declared of type of structure.
- structure are defined outside any function
```c
//struct define
struct student 
{
int roll;
float fee;
};

main ()
{
// student typr variable delaration
struct student rohan;
rohan.roll=90;
rohan.fee = 1700.90;

}
```
- use arrow (->) to access struct member through pointer;
```c
struct student 
{
 int roll;
 int age;
};

main ()
{
 struct student s1;
 struct student *p = &s1;
 //access struct member through pointer
 p1->roll = 12; // (*p1).roll = 12;
 p1->fee=120.90; 
}
```


### **Union**
- Overlapping structure 
- Space allocated to a union variable = max (size of  members)
- otherwise same as struct


### **Enumlator**
- enum 
 ```c
enum boolean
{

 true='c' ,
 false=90
};

int main ()
{
 enum boolean b;
}
 
```
