### **Object Oriented Programming**
- OOPs is programming methodlogy of programming or programming paradigm

### **Class and Object**
- **Class :** Class is a blueprint for creating objects. Class can have properties and behaviours.
- **Object :** Object is instance of class has properties and behaviours. We can create multiple obejcts of a class.
```kotlin
//class
class ClassName
{
//properties
//method or member function  
}
fun main ()
{
//object
var name = ClassName()
}

```

---
### **Constructor**
- Constructor are like member functions that are called when object of the class is created , they initilize the data member for objects.
- **1.Primary constructor**
	- mainly for initilization but can be write logic/statement with hekp of init 
```kotlin
//class
class ClassName (var name:String ,var age:Int) //construction for initilization 

{

 init //construction for execute statment 
 {
  //write code here which run when object created
 }

}
```
- **2.Secondary consructor**
	- we do both initilization and logic/statement  
```kotlin
class ClassName
{
 constructor (name:String, age:Int)
 {
   this.name = name
   this.age = age
   print("Constructor is runing")
 }
}
```
---
### **Getter-Setter**
- when we access propeties => get call
- when we set properties => set call

```kotlin
class MyClass 
{
  var name:String = "default"
get ()
{
 print ("i am get")
 return field
}
 set (value)
 {
 print("i am set")
  field = value
 }
  
}

fun main ()
{
 var obj = MyClass()
print(obj.name) // get call

obj.name = "myname" //set call
}

```

---
### **Visibility Modifiers**
- In kotlin , visiablity modifiers are used to control the visibility of a class , its members (properties , function and nested classes) and its constructor
- **public :** The public modifiers makes a member visible to any code , This is the default visibility for member in kotlin
- **private :** The private modifiers restricts the visiablity of a member to the containing class only . A private private member cannot be accessed from outside the class.
- **internal** : the internal modifiers restrict the visibility of a member to the same module. A module is a set of kotlin files compiled together
- **protected**: The protected modifiers restricts the visiablity of a member the containing class and its subclass

---
### **Inheritence**
- by default inheritence close (final calss)
```kotlin
open class MyClass
{
    var name:String = "no name"
    
}

class YourClass : MyClass()
{
    var age:Int = 12
}
```

---

### **Overloading and Overriding (polymorphism)**


### **Abstraction and Interface**
- we can extend multiple interface but not class
---

### **Data Class**
```kotlin
data class User
{

}
```

---
### **Sealed Class and Enum Class** 

---

### **Generic**
```kotlin
class Box<T>(private val item: T) {
    fun getItem(): T = item
}

fun main() {
    val intBox = Box(10)          // Box of Int
    val stringBox = Box("Hello")  // Box of String

    println(intBox.getItem())     // 10
    println(stringBox.getItem())  // Hello
}

```
