### **Android Architecture**
![[Pasted image 20250119180811.png]]
- **Linux Kernel**
	- Aka root layer/super layer
	- It is like heart of anfroid operating system and present at the bottom of android architecture.
	- It contains essential hardware drivers like display , audio , camera , blutooth , wifi etc.   
	- It provides functionalities such as power management , process managment and memory managment.
	- It provides a level of abstraction between device hardware and upper layers of android software stack.
- **Libraries**
	-  Above linux kernel there are native libraries such as SQlite , WebKit , OpenGL , SSL  etc  
	- SQLite : It provides various classes used for database managment.
	- WebKit : It is a web browser engine used to display internet content.
	- SSL : It provides internet security.
	- OpenGL : It is a java interface to the OpenGL ES 3D graphics rendring API.
- **Android Run Time**
	- It is third section which is also present on the second layer from bottom of android architecture.
	- Android Runtime provides core libraries and Dalvik virtual machine (DVM).
	- The core libraries enable android devlopers to write android application using Java programming language.
	- DVM is a major component of android OS . It is same as Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
	- DVM is responsible for running android applications . it consumes less memory and provides very fast performance.
- **Application Framework** 
	- It is fourth section and third layer present on the top of native libraries and android runtime.
	- It proidvides various API's like activity manager , resource manager , content proiders , telephony manager , etc.
- **Application Layer** 
	- Application layer is present at the top . various applications created by developers like game , contacts , browser , etc . are installed on this layer

### **Basic Idea of Devlopment**
- User Interface - XML
- Backend - Java/Kotlin
- **Pillars of Devlopment**
	- **Activity :** Single Screen with some action . Like one webpage . Activity is UI componet
	- **Services :** Long runining task in backgound
	- **Broadcast Receiver :** messaging system across apps
	- **Content Providers :** Provide data from one app to another app

---
### **Setup**
- Android Studio -> IDE
- SDK -> JRE 
- Empty Activity = Jetpack Compose (no XML )
- Empty Views Activity = XML and can choose JAVA / Kotlin

---
### **Project Strcuture** 
- **Manifests folder**
	-  It contain **AndroidManifest.xml** file which is heart of android project.
	- This file contains information about our application such as app metadata, android version,app name, activities, permissions, and much more.
		- 1. How many activity we have created and their names
		- 2. Which activity shold open first.
		- 3. permissions
		- 4. App theme , icons
		- 5. Services etc
- **Java folder**
	- This folder contain source code java/kotlin
- **Resource folder(res)**
	- This folder contain all non-code resources such as images, audio, video, menus, styles, strings,etc
	- **drawable*** :  contains assets like images etc
	- **layout** : Contain all xml layouts
	- **mipmap** : Contains file to defined icons 
	- **values** :  Contains files like strings, dimensions, colors etc
- **Gradle Scripts folder**
	- Gradle is an opensource system which is used to automate  building , testing , deploment etc of our application.
	- Gradle is also used to generate .apk file from .java and .xml file.  
	- Gradle folder contains many files used to defined number of configuraion files.
	- build.gradle(project) Is used to specify global build configurations for the entire project, including the repositories where dependencies can be found and the version of the Android build tools to use.
	- build.gradle(module) Is used to specify the build configurations for a specific module within the project, sdk versiobn , project version , target sdk such as the dependencies, build tools, and other settings needed to build and run the app.
	- gradle.setting Is used to specify project-wide settings for the build process, including which modules should be included in the project and how they should be organized.
	- gradle-wrapper.properties Is used to specify the version of Gradle to use for the build process.

### **Android SDK**
- SDK stands for "Software Develomrnt Kit".
- As the name suggests that android sdk is a set of devlopment tool which includes debugger , libraries , documentation , sample code , tutorial , emulaor (AVD) etc.
- Whenever google release new android version , it also release the new version of SDK.
- Andrid SDK contain three components :
	- SDK Platforms
	- SDK Tool
	- SDK Updates Sites![[Pasted image 20250314105010.png]]

### **Emulator (AVD)** 
- Emulator is virtual device which acts same as physical mobile device.
- Emulator used to test , debug and execte our android apk.
