### **Android Components**
- App components are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each component is an entry point through which the system or a user can enter your app. Some components depend on others.
- There are four types of app components:
	- Activities
	- Services
	- Broadcast receivers
	- Content providers
- Each type serves a distinct purpose and has a distinct lifecycle that defines how a component is created and destroyed.
---

### **Activities**
- An activity reprsents a single screen with a user interface , in-short Activity performs actions on the screen .
- Activity = forntend (XML) + backend ( JAVA / KOTLIN) , that provide interaction with user like event listener.
```kotlin
class MainActivity: AppCompatActivity() {  
  
   override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {  
   super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)  
   setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)  

   }  
}
```

### **Services**
- Service is another Android App Component which gives the ability to execute long running tasks in the background even if the application gets closed.
- To declare a service in Android we can extend from the Service class and override **onStartCommand()** and **bind().** 
```kotlin 
class MyService: Service() {  

   override fun onBind(p0: Intent?): IBinder? {  
   // Used to bind the service with an activity or another part of the app to       send  and receive results  
   return null  
   }  
  
   override fun onStartCommand(intent: Intent?, flags: Int, startId: Int): Int { 
   // Gets called when receiving a new Intent  
   return super.onStartCommand(intent, flags, startId)  
   }  
}```
- And inside the Manifist file add your service inside the application tag.
	- \<service android:name=".MyService"/> 
-  Service Types
	- 1. Started Service : Services that are started from another Application Component such as an Activity or a Broadcast Receiver. For example syncing the user data with the backend server or uploading the craches reports.
	- 2. Bound Service : Same as Started service but it can receives actions and send out results. this Bound Service used when we expect interactions between the user and the Service. For example a service that runs music needs to be able to show the progress of the song and also gives the ability to the user to change the song.
	- NOTE : The android system might kill the previous types of services if it needs more memory.
	- 3. Foreground Service : It’s a normal service but with higher propriety than the Started Service. Foreground Service is used to show a notification to inform the user about the service being running. And the Android System will not kill this service even if it needs resources.And to make your service a foreground service you need to add this function inside onStartCommand() : \[ startForeground(1,notification) ] . And add this Install-time permission in the Manifist file :
```kotlin 
<uses-permission android:name =  "android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE " />
```

### **Broadcast Receivers**
- Broadcast Receiver is a way to communicate between apps to be notified about something. For example you can have a broadcast receiver to know when the device is booted up.
- Broadcast  receivers simply respond to broadcast message form the other applications or form the system. 
- To create a broadcast receiver you can extend from BroadcastReceiver class and override the onReceiver function.
```kotlin
class BootupReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() {  
	override fun onReceive(context: Context?, intent: Intent?) {  
	
	if (intent?.action == Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED){  
	// Do something  
	                }  
  }  
}
```
- Broadcast Receiver Types
- 1. Static : These are broadcasts that can be registered in the Manifist file and they sent by the Android system itself, your app will receive the broadcast even if its not active. To register a static broadcast receiver :
```kotlin
<service  
    android:name=".BootupReceiver"  
    android:exported="false">  
    <intent-filter>  
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED" />  
    </intent-filter>  
</service>
```
- 2. Dynamic : Most of the broadcasts are registered during the run-time, For example registering a receiver to be notified about AIRPLANE mode changes.
``` kotlin
class AirplaneChangeReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() {  
    override fun onReceive(context: Context?, intent: Intent?) {  
        if (intent?.action == Intent.ACTION_AIRPLANE_MODE_CHANGED){  
            Log.d("test","Airplane Mode Changed")  
        }  
    }  
}
```

```kotlin
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {  
    val airplaneChangeReceiver = AirplaneChangeReceiver()  
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {  
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)  
  
        registerReceiver(  
            airplaneChangeReceiver,  
            IntentFilter(Intent.ACTION_AIRPLANE_MODE_CHANGED)  
        )  
    }  
}
```

---
### **Content Provider**
- A content provider component supplies data form one application to others on request . Such requests are handled by the methods of the ContentResolver class.
 ```kotlin
 public class MyContentProvider : ConetentProvider 
 {
   public void onCreate()
	{
	
	}
 }
 
```
![[Pasted image 20250208151128.png]]

- **Content URI(Uniform Resource Identifier)** is the key concept of Content providers. To access the data from a content provider, URI is used as a query string.

To access data through a Content Provider, you use URIS. A URI represents a unique identifier for a specific resource within the Content Provider. The URI typically consists of a scheme, authority, path, and optionally, query parameters. The Content Provider defines the structure and format of the URIs it supports, which determine how data can be accessed.

To get the Contacts List URI :
```kotlin
val contactsListUri = ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_URI

Now to fetch the contacts list you can use the ContentResolver class

val contactsListUri = ContactsContract.Contacts.CONTENT_URI  
val cursor = contentResolver.query(contactsListUri,null,null,null,null)  
cursor.use {  
    it?.let {cursor ->  
        if (cursor.moveToFirst()){  
            do {  
                //Here you can get a single row  
            }while (cursor.moveToNext())  
        }  
    }  
}
```

NOTE : You need to grant the READ_CONTACTS permission.
-  ContentResolver functions
	- 1. **Insert**: This method allows you to insert a new record or set of records into the Content Provider. You provide the URI of the data you want to insert, along with the values for the columns in the record.
	- 2. **Query**: The query method retrieves data from the Content Provider. You specify the URI and can optionally provide selection criteria, sort order, and projection, which determines the columns to include in the result set. The query method returns a Cursor object containing the retrieved data.
	- 3. **Update**: This method updates existing records in the Content Provider. You specify the URI of the data to update, along with the new values for the columns. You can also provide selection criteria to update specific records.
	- 4. **Delete**: The delete method removes one or more records from the Content Provider. You specify the URI and can optionally provide selection criteria to delete specific records.

### **Intent**
- The dictionary meaning of intent is intention or purpose , thus here intent defined as the intention to do any action. 
- Intent can also be said as message , to perform an action on the screen.
- Intent used to comnicate between compopnets in a application and between application.
- Actions that can be performed by an intent are :
	- Lanuch another activity 
	- Start the service 
	- Broadcast a message 
- Programatically Intent are the objects which is used to pass the information between the activites within single or multiple application.
- Example :
```java
Intent i = new Intent (context , SecondActivity)
startActivity(i) //or startService();
```
- Types of Intent
	- 1. Implicit Intent : Implicit intent provides the infomation to the avaliable component provided by the system that is to be invoked
