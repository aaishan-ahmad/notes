### **Android Components**
- App components are the essential building blocks of an Android app. Each component is an entry point through which the system or a user can enter your app. Some components depend on others.
- There are four types of app components:
	- Activities
	- Services
	- Broadcast receivers
	- Content providers
- Each type serves a distinct purpose and has a distinct lifecycle that defines how a component is created and destroyed.

### **Activities**
- An activity reprsents a single screen with a user interface , in-short Activity performs actions on the screen .
- Activity = forntend (XML) + backend ( JAVA / KOTLIN) , that provide interaction with user like event listener.
```kotlin
class MainActivity: AppCompatActivity() {  
  
   override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {  
   super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)  
   setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)  

   }  
}
```

### **Services**
- Service is another Android App Component which gives the ability to execute long running tasks in the background even if the application gets closed.
- To declare a service in Android we can extend from the Service class and override **onStartCommand()** and **bind().**
