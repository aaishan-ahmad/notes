### **Toast**
- Toast is nothing more than a message appears on the screen or activity of your application .
- It appears for short duration and then it disppears.
- Why we use Toast
	- Giving users feedback regarding some operation.
	- It doesn't block the activity or the fragment in which it appears.
	- It  is not like dialoge(in javascript , webdev). it just appears on the top of your activity and disappears after a short time
- Create and run
```java
//SYNTAX
Toast toast = Toast.makeText(Context c , CharSequence text, int duration);
toast.show();

//EXAMPLE 

Toast t = Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this,"hello",Toast.LENGTH_LONG)
t.show();
```
