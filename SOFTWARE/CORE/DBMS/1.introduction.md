### **What is data**
- Data means know facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaing.
- In simple word data is information.
- In software system we manage data.
- Manage data means storing and extracting data.

---
### **Data Persistence**
- Data persistence means existence data.
- In any program we want to manage data.
- Data that is required to manage needs to be stored somewhere until job is not over.
---
### **Life of Data**
- Constants in the expression.
- Data stored in variable.
- Data stored in secondary storage.
---
### **What is Database**
- A software application most of the times require to store relevant informaion in the secondary storage.
- A database is a place where all your application releted data is stored.
- one applicato data can be stored in a bunch of files.
- We can say , database is a collections of files.

### **What is File Handling**
- FIle need to be handled by set of programs.
- Ths bunch of programs is a part of actual application.![[Pasted image 20250419081349.png]]

### **What is DBMS**
- DBMS is database meanagment system.
- It is a collection of program that enables user to create  maintain database.

### **Database Architecture**
- Database architecture is DMS is logcally divided into two types 
- **1. Two Tier Client Server Architrcure**
	- Two tier architecture is used for application programs that runs on client side.
	- An inteface called ODBC (Open Database connectivity) provides APJ that allow client side program to call the dbms.
	- Most DBMS vendors provide ODBC drivers.![[Pasted image 20250419082807.png]] 
- **2. Three Tier Client Sercver Architecture**
	- Three tier client server database architecture is comonly used architecture for web application .
	- Intermediate layer called application server.![[Pasted image 20250419083313.png]]

### **Database Model**
- Database model is a logical frame in which data is stored.
- The model also describe the relationship between different parts of the data.
- Traditional models 
	- 1. Hierarchical Model
	- 2. Network Model
	- 3. Relational Model
---
### **Hierarchical Model (Not use)**
- In this model each entity has only one parent but can have several children.
- At the top of hierarch there is only one entity which is called root.

### **Network Model (Not use)**
- In this model , entwities are organised in a graph , in which some entities can be accessed through sevral path.![[Pasted image 20250419091600.png]]

---
### **Relatinal Model**
- In this model , data is organised in two dimensional tables called relations.![[Pasted image 20250419091946.png]]
