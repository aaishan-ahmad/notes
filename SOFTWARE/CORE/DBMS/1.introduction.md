 
### **What is data**
- Data means know facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning.
- In simple word data is information.
- In software system we manage data.
- Manage data means storing and extracting data.

---
### **Data Persistence**
- Data persistence means existence data.
- In any program we want to manage data.
- Data that is required to manage needs to be stored somewhere until job is not over.
---
### **Life of Data**
- Constants in the expression.
- Data stored in variable.
- Data stored in secondary storage.
---
### **What is Database**
- A software application most of the times require to store relevant informaion in the secondary storage.
- A database is a place where all your application releted data is stored.
- one applicato data can be stored in a bunch of files.
- We can say , database is a collections of files.
---
### **What is File Handling**
- FIle need to be handled by set of programs.
- Ths bunch of programs is a part of actual application.![[Pasted image 20250419081349.png]]
---
### **What is DBMS**
- DBMS is database meanagment system.
- It is a collection of program that enables user to create  maintain database.
- The DBMS is a general purpose software system that facilites the process of defining , constructing , manuplating , and saring database amnge various user and application.

### **Database**
-  It is a place where you store your business data.
- Logically database is a collection of tables.
- Physically database is a collection of a files.

### **Database Architecture**
- Database architecture is DMS is logcally divided into two types 
- **1. Two Tier Client Server Architrcure**
	- Two tier architecture is used for application programs that runs on client side.
	- An inteface called ODBC (Open Database connectivity) provides API that allow client side program to call the dbms.
	- Most DBMS vendors provide ODBC drivers.![[Pasted image 20250419082807.png]] 
- **2. Three Tier Client Sercver Architecture**
	- Three tier client server database architecture is comonly used architecture for web application .
	- Intermediate layer called application server.![[Pasted image 20250419083313.png]]

---
### **Database Model**
- Database model is a logical frame in which data is stored.
- The model also describe the relationship between different parts of the data.
- Traditional models 
	- 1. Hierarchical Model
	- 2. Network Model
	- 3. Relational Model
---
### **Hierarchical Model (Not use)**
- In this model each entity has only one parent but can have several children.
- At the top of hierarch there is only one entity which is called root.

---
### **Network Model (Not use)**
- In this model , entwities are organised in a graph , in which some entities can be accessed through sevral path.![[Pasted image 20250419091600.png]]

---
### **Relatinal Model**
- In this model , data is organised in two dimensional tables called relations.![[Pasted image 20250419091946.png]]
---
### **RDBMS**
- A relational database managment system (RDBMS) is a database managment system related based on relational model introduces by E.R Codd.
- In relational model , data is represented in terms of tuples(rows).
- RDBMS is used to manage relational database.
---
### **Tables**
- Relational database is a collection of organized set of tables from which data can be accessed  easily.
- Database is a collection of tables (Conceptually).
- A table is a collections of data elements organised in terms of rows and column. 
- A column is a set of type value of a particular type.
- Each row in a table called record.![[Pasted image 20250419111811.png]]
---
### **Coold's 12 Rules (0 to 12)**
- Edgar Frank "Ted" Codd was an english computer scientist,  who invented the relational model for database managment.
- Rule 0 :
	- The system must qualify as relational as a database and as a managment system.
	- For a system to qualify as a relational database managment system , that must use relational facilities to manage database .
	- Other 1 to 12 rules derive from this rule.
- Rule 1 : Information Rule
	- All infromation is to be represented as stored data in cells of table 
	- The rows and columns have tobe strictly unordered.
- Rule 2 : Guarantied Access
	- Each unique piece of data (atom value) should be accessible by : Table name + Primary Key (row) + Attribute (column).
- Rule 3 : Systematic Treatment of NULL
	- NULL has several meanings it can mean missing data , not applicable or no value It should be handled consistently.
	- Primary key must not be NULL.
	- Expression on NULL must give null.
- Rule 4 : Active Online Catalogue
	- Database dictionary must have description of database.
- Rule 5 : Powerful Language 
	- One well defiend language must be there to provide all manners of access data.
	- Like SQL
- Rule 6 : View Updation
	- All view that are theoretically updateable should be updateable by the system
	- View is a virtual table.
- Rule 7 : Relational level operation
	- There must be insert , delete , update , operations at each level of relationals.
	- Set operation like union , intersection and minus should also be supported.
- Rule 8 : Physical Data Independence 
	- The physical storage of data should not matter to the system .
	- If say some file supporting table were renamed or moved form one directory to another , it should not effect the application.
- Rule 9 : Logical Data Independence
	- If there is change in the logical structure (table structures) of the database the user view of data shuld not change.
	- Say , if a table is split into two table a new view should give result as the join of the two tables . This rules is most difficult to satisfy.
- Rule 10 : Integrity Independence
	- The database should be able to conforce its own integrity rather than using other programs . Key & check constran trigger et should be stored in data dicitonary . This make RDBMS independent frontend.
- Rule 11 : Distribution Independence
	- A database should work properly regardless of its distribution across a network. This lays foundation of distributed databases.
- Rule 12 : Non-Subversion Rule
	- If low level access is allowed to a system it shoud not be able to subvert or bypass integrity rule to change data.
	- This can be achived by some sort of looking or encryption.
---
### **Keys**
- Keys are , a key part of of a relational database.
- They ensure each record within a table can be uniquely identified by one or a combination of fields within the table.
- There are three main types of keys
	- 1. Candidate key
	- 2. Primary key
	- 3. Foreign key
	- 4. Super key
---
### **Super Key**
- Super ke is any combnation of fields within a table that uniquely identifies each record within that table eg : a student table super key is phone o OR email OR roll no OR name + roll no etc.
---
### **Candidate Key**
- A candidate key is a subset of a super key.
- A candidate key is a single field that uniquely identifies each record in the table.
- eg : roll no  , email

---
### **Primary Key**
- Once your candidate keys have been idetified you can select one to be yur primary key.
- A primary key is a candidate key that is most apporiate to be mai refrence key for the table.
- eg : roll no
---
### **Foreign Key**
- A foreign key is a primary key from one table that appears as a field in another where the first table has a relationship to the second.
---
### **ER - Diagram**
- ER-Diagram is a diagrammatic representation of logical structure of database.
- ER diagram describes relationships between tables.
- Peter chen developed ER Diagram in 1976.
- Since then charles bachman ad james martin have added some slight refinements to the basic ERD principles 
- **Entity :** The basic object that the ER model represents is an entity model represents is an entity , which is a thing in real world with an independent existence like student , teacher , batch , course.
- **Attributes :** Each entity has attributes . They are the properties whose values are the data that stored in the database. eg : in student entity attributes is name , roll no , class , phone no.
- Types of attributes 
	- Atomic vs composite :phone no is atomic and address is composite(combination) attribute
	- Single valued vs Multivalued :  two phon no of a man multivalued
	- Stored vs Derived : derived mean make of other data like total marks
	- Null Valued
	- Key Attributes

### **Normalization**
- The normalization proces was first proposed by codd n 1972.
- This process takes a relation schema through a series of tests to certify whether it satisfies a certain noraml form .
---
### **How many normal forms?**
- Initially , codd proposed three normal forms , which he called first , second & third normal form.
- A stronger  defination of third normal form is called Boyce-Codd normal form, was proposed later by Boyce & Codd.
- Later fourth and fifth normal form were proposed.
---
### **Why Normalization**
- It is the process of analyzing te given relation schema based on their functional dependecies & primary keys to achive the desirable properties of 
	- Minimizing redundancy
	- Minimizing the insertion , deletion and update.
---
### **First Normal Form**
- First normal from states that , the domain of an attriutes must incude only atmic values.
---
### **Second Normal Form**
- Second normal form (2NF) is a normal form used in database normalization.
- 2NF was originally defined by E.E-Codd
- A table that is in first normal form must meet additional criteria if it is to qualify for second normal form.
- Second normal form state that it should meet all the rules for 1NF & there must be no patial dependences of any of the column on the primary key.

---
### **Third Normal Form**
- Codd's definition states that a table is in 3NF if and only if both of the following condition hold.
	- The relation R (table)  is in second normal form (2NF)
	- Every non-prime attribute of R is non-transitively dependent of every key of R.
