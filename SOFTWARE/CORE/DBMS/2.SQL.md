### **SQL**
- SQL stands for structured query language.
- It is lanuage to access and manipulate databases.
- 
- Standard lanuage (ANSI standard) for dealing with all relational database eg: oracle , Mysql , MSsql , SQL server , DB2 etc.
- Initialy developed by IBM.
- Initial name was SEQUEL ( Structure English Query Lanuage).
- Althogh most database systems use SQL most of them also have their own additional property extensions that are usally only used on their system
- **Types of SQL commands**
	- 1. DDL (Data Definition Language) : Commands to create , drop , truncate & alter are DDL command.
	- 2. DML (Data Manipulation Lanuage) : DML command are insertion of data into table updating and deleting data from table 
	- Extracting data without removing data from the table.

### **Integrity Constrains**
- Integrity means purity completness constraints means check point .
- Integrity constraints provide a way of ensuring that changes made to the database by authorized users do not result in a loss of data consistency.
- Integrity means someting like 'be right' and consistent
- Types of integrity
	- 1. Domain Integrity
	- 2. Entity Integrity
	- 3. Reterential integrity
	- 4. Foreign Key Integrity
---
### **Domain Integrity**
- Domain integrity means the definition of a valid set of values for an attributes . you define 
	- Data Type
	- Length or Size
	- Is null vlaue allowed
	- Is the value unique
	- Default value
	- Range of value

---
### **Entity Integrity**
- The entity integrity constrain states that primary keys can't be null.
- There must be a proper value in the primary key field.
- This is because the primary key value is used to idetify individual rows in a table.
---
### **Referential Integrity**
- The referntail integrity costrainst is specified between two tables & it is used to maintain the consistency amonge rows between the two tables.
- **Rules**
	- 1. You can't record from a primary table if matchin records exist in a related table.
	- 2. You can't chnage a primary key value in the primary table if that record has related records.
	- 3. You can't enter a value in the forign key field of the related table that doesn't exist in the primary key of the primary table.
	- 4. However , yu can enter a Null value in the foreign key , specifying that the records are unrelated.
---
### **Foreign Key Integrity**
- There are two foregin key integrity constraints.
	- **1. Cascade update related fields**
		- Any time you change the primary key of a row in the primary table , the foreign key vaues are updated in the matching rows in the related table.
		- This constraint overrules rule 2 in the referential integrity constraints.
	- **2. Cascade delet related rows**
		- Any time you delet row in the priary table , the matching rows are automatically deleted the related table.
		- This constraint overule rule 1 in referentail ntegrity constraints.

### **SQL Constraints**
- NOT NULL
- UNIQUE
- CHECKS 
- DEFAULT 
- INDEX
---
### **SQL Commands**
- 1. Create Database : CREATE DATABASE database_name
- 2. Create Table : CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name tpe \[constriant] , ...)
