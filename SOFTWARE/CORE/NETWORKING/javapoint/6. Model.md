### Model
- In computer networking, a **model** is a conceptual framework that helps us understand how networks function. A **layer** is a specific level within this model, each responsible for a particular set of tasks. A **layer architecture** is the overall structure of these layers and their interactions.
- A communication subsystem is a complex piece of Hardware and software. Early attempts for implementing the software for such subsystems were based on a single, complex, unstructured program with many interacting components. The resultant software was very difficult to test and modify. To overcome such problem, the ISO has developed a layered approach. In a layered approach, networking concept is divided into several layers, and each layer is assigned a particular task. Therefore, we can say that networking tasks depend upon the layers.

### Layer Architecture
- The main aim of the layered architecture is to dividing the network into layers makes it easier to manage and troubleshoot.Each layer has specific standards and protocols, promoting interoperability.Changes in one layer can be made without affecting others.By breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable ones, layer architecture improves efficiency.
- Each layer has a specific job (like icing, cake, filling).
- Layers work together to create the whole cake (communication).
-  Data doesn't jump straight from top to bottom.
- The top layer sends data down, each layer adding its service (like baking the cake).
- Data travels back up as services are completed (like assembling the cake).
-  The basic elements of layered architecture are services, protocols, and interfaces.
    - **Service:** It is a set of actions that a layer provides to the higher layer.
    - **Protocol:** It defines a set of rules that a layer uses to exchange the information with peer entity. These rules mainly concern about both the contents and order of the messages used.
    - **Interface:** It is a way through which the message is transferred from one layer to another layer.
- In a layer n architecture, layer n on one machine will have a communication with the layer n on another machine and the rules used in a conversation are known as a layer-n protocol.
- The data is passed from the upper layer to lower layer through an interface. A Layered architecture provides a clean-cut interface so that minimum information is shared among different layers. It also ensures that the implementation of one layer can be easily replaced by another implementation.
- A set of layers and protocols is known as network architecture.

### OSI Model
- OSI stands for **Open System Interconnection** is a reference model that describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer.
- OSI model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984, and it is now considered as an architectural model for the inter-computer communications.
- OSI model divides the whole task into seven smaller and manageable tasks. Each layer is assigned a particular task.
- Each layer is self-contained, so that task assigned to each layer can be performed independently.
- OSI consists of seven layers, and each layer performs a particular network function.
- 1. **Physical Layer** : Provides a physical medium through which bits are transmitted.
- 2. **Data Link Layer** : Used for error-free transfer of data frames.
- 3. **Network Layer** : Responsible for moving packets from source to destination.
- 4. **Transport Layer** : Provides reliable message delivery from process to process.
- 5. **Session Layer** : Used to establish, manage, and terminate sessions.
- 6. **Presentation Layer** : Responsible for translation, compression, and encryption.
- 7. **Application Layer** : Provides services to the user.

### Characteristics of OSI Model
- The OSI model is divided into two layers: upper layers and lower layers.
- The upper layer of the OSI model mainly deals with the application related issues, and they are implemented only in the **software**. The application layer is closest to the end user. Both the end user and the application layer interact with the software applications. An upper layer refers to the layer just above another layer.
- The lower layer of the OSI model deals with the data transport issues. The data link layer and the physical layer are implemented in hardware and software. The physical layer is the lowest layer of the OSI model and is closest to the physical medium. The physical layer is mainly responsible for placing the information on the physical medium.

### TCP/IP Model
- TCP/IP protocol suite was developed before the OSI model.
- The TCP/IP model is not exactly similar to the OSI model.
- The **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model** is a practical, conceptual framework that defines how data is exchanged over the internet and similar networks. It’s the basis for most networking and communication across modern devices and systems. The model has four main layers, each performing specific functions to ensure data moves efficiently from one device to another.
-  **Link Layer** (or Network Interface Layer): Corresponds to the Physical and Data Link layers in the OSI model.
    
- **Internet Layer** : Corresponds to the Network layer in the OSI model.
- **Transport Layer** : Corresponds to the Transport layer in the OSI model.
	- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Provides reliable, connection-oriented data transfer with error recovery and flow control.
    - UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Offers faster, connectionless data transfer, suitable for applications where speed is more critical than reliability (e.g., video streaming or online gaming).
- **Application Layer** : Corresponds to the OSI model's Application, Presentation, and Session layers.

### History of TCP/IP Model
- In 1969 the Defense Advanced research projects Agency (DARPA) funded a research and development project to create an experimental packet switching network. This network is called ARPANET. 
- In 1975 the ARPANET was converted from an experimental network to an operational network, and the responsibility for administering the network was given to the Defense Communication Agency (DCA). 
- The TCP/IP protocols were adopted as Military Standards (MIL STD) in 1983, and all hosts connected to the network were required to convert to the new protocols. 
- DARPA funded to implement TCP/IP in BerkelyUnix. • In 1983, the old ARPANET was divided into MILNET and smaller ARPANET. The Internet was used to refer to the entire network; MILNET and ARPANET.
