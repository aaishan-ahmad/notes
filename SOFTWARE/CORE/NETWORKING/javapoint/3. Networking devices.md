### NIC / Ethernet card

- Ethernet card, also known as Network Interface Card (NIC card in short) is a network adapter used to set up a wired network.
- NIC is a hardware component used to connect a computer with another computer onto a network
- It can support a transfer rate of 10,100 to 1000 Mb/s.
- It acts as an interface between computer and the network. It is a circuit board mounted on the motherboard of a computer as shown in Figure .
- The Ethernet cable connects the computer to the network through NIC. Ethernet cards can support data transfer between 10 Mbps and 1 Gbps (1000 Mbps). Each NIC has a MAC address, which helps in uniquely identifying the computer on the network.
- The MAC address or physical address is encoded on the network card chip which is assigned by the IEEE to identify a network card uniquely. The MAC address is stored in the PROM (Programmable read-only memory).

- **There are two types of NIC:**
  - 1.  Wired NIC : The Wired NIC is present inside the motherboard. Cables and connectors are used with wired NIC to transfer data.
  - 2.  Wireless NIC: The wireless NIC contains the antenna to obtain the connection over the wireless network. For example, laptop computer contains the wireless NIC.

### **RJ45**

- RJ 45 or Registered Jack-45 is an eight-pin connector (Figure 10.10) that is used exclusively with Ethernet cables for networking.
- It is a standard networking interface that can be seen at the end of all network cables. Basically, it is a small plastic plug that fits into RJ-45 jacks of the Ethernet cards present in various computing devices. -![RJ45](/_resource/Pasted%20image%2020241106190547.png)

### Repeater

- Used to generate incoming electrical, wireless or optical signals
- Data are carried in the form of signals over the cable. These signals can travel a specified distance (usually about 100 m). Signals lose their strength beyond this limit and become weak. In such conditions, original signals need to be regenerated.
- A repeater is an analog device that works with signals on the cables to which it is connected. The weakened signal appearing on the cable is regenerated and put back on the cable by a repeater.

### HUB

- An Ethernet hub is a network device used to connect different devices through wires. Data arriving on any of the lines are sent out on all the others. The limitation of Hub is that if data from two devices come at the same time, they will collide.
- It is a small network device. It joins multiple computers together to form a single network segment. On this segment, all computers can interact with each other.
- half-duplex

### Switch

- A switch is more advanced and connects multiple devices within a network, forwarding data only to the specific device that needs it. It uses MAC addresses to identify connected devices.
- A switch is a networking device (Figure 10.12) that plays a central role in a Local Area Network (LAN). Like a hub, a network switch is used to connect multiple computers or communicating devices.When data arrives, the switch extracts the destination address from the data packet and looks it up in a table to see where to send the packet. Thus, it sends signals to only selected devices instead of sending to all.
- It Operates at the **data link layer (Layer 2)** of the OSI model. Some advanced switches also work at **Layer 3 (network layer)** and can perform routing functions.
- It can forward multiple packets at the same time.
- full-duplex

### Bridge

- A bridge in computer networking is a device used to connect and manage traffic between two or more network segments, making them function as a single network.
- It reads the outermost section of the data packet to tell where the message is going. It reduces the traffic on other network segments.

### Router

- A router is a network device that can receive the data, analyse it and transmit it to other networks.
- A router connects a local area network to the internet. Compared to a hub or a switch, a router has advanced capabilities as it can analyse the data being carried over a network, decide/alter how it is packaged, and send it to another network of a different type. For example, data has been divided into packets of a certain size. Suppose these packets are to be carried over a different type of network which cannot handle bigger packets. In such a case, the data is to be repackaged as smaller packets and then sent over the network by a router.
- A router can be wired or wireless. A wireless router can provide Wi-Fi access to smartphones and other devices. Usually, such routers also contain some ports to provide wired Internet access. These days, home Wi-Fi routers perform the dual task of a router and a modem/ switch. These routers connect to incoming broadband lines, from ISP (Internet Service Provider), and convert them to digital data for computing devices to process.

### Moderm

- Modem stands for ‘MOdulator DEModulator’.
- It refers to a device used for conversion between analog signals and digital bits(signal).
- We know computers store and process data in terms of 0s and 1s. However, to transmit data from a sender to a receiver, or while browsing the internet, digital data are converted to an analog signal and the medium (be it free-space or a physical media) carries the signal to the receiver. There are modems connected to both the source and destination nodes.
- The modem at the sender’s end acts as a modulator that converts the digital data into analog signals. The modem at the receiver’s end acts as a demodulator that converts the analog signals into digital data for the destination node to understand.

### Gateway

- A gateway in a computer network is a critical device that serves as a connection point between two different networks that use different protocols. It acts as an entry and exit point for data traffic and helps facilitate communication between systems that would otherwise be incompatible.
- A gateway can translate data between different network protocols or data formats, allowing communication between heterogeneous networks (e.g., connecting an internal company network to the public Internet).
- It enables connectivity between two or more dissimilar networks, such as a local area network (LAN) and a wide area network (WAN).
- A gateway marks the boundary where one network ends, and another begins, controlling traffic flow and acting as an intermediary.
- Besides routing data packets, gateways also maintain information about the host network's internal connection paths and the identified paths of other remote networks. If a node from one network wants to communicate with a node of a foreign network, it will pass the data packet to the gateway, which then routes it to the destination using the best possible route.
- Generally, a router is configured to work as a gateway device in computer networks. But a gateway can be implemented completely in software, hardware, or a combination of both. Because a network gateway is placed at the edge of a network, the firewall is usually integrated with it.

### Cables and Connector

- Cable is a transmission media used for transmitting a signal.
- There are three types of cables used in transmission:
  - Twisted pair cable
  - Coaxial cable
  - Fibre-optic cable
