### **Data Structure**
- Mathematical and logical model of organize the interrealted data.
	- Mathamatical means : Predefine structure to organize data.
	- Logical means : Operation .
- Need : Select a data strcutuer which can help to solve a problem optimally.
- **Types** : We have two types of data structure 
	-  Linear : Elements are arranged  in linear fashion. Ex : Array , Linked-List ,Queue , Stack.
	- Non-Linear : Elements are arranged in non-linear fashion . Ex: Tree , Graphs , Hash table.

---
### **Classification of Data Structure**
- Classification based on why data strcure use
- 1. Container : use to  only store the data ex: Array , Linked-list
- 2. Priority : specific priority strcuture   Ex: Queue , Stack , heap
- 3. Indexing : Ex: BST , B-Tree , B+ Tree , Hash table

### **Operation on Data Structure**
- 1. Traversing  : Visiting each and every element atlest and atmost once.
- 2. Insertion : Adding an element in a data structure.
	- overflow : Error occur , when trying to insert an element in a d.s which is full   
- 3. Deletion : Removing an element from a data structure .
	- underflow : Error occur , when we tryring to delete from an empty data structure.   
- 4. Searching : Finding an element in a data structure.
	- output : Location of element  ![[Pasted image 20241230115321.png]]
- 5. Merging : Combing 2 data structures of same type into one.
- 6. Sorting : Arringing the elements in ascending or descending order.
