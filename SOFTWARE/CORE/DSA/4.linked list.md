### **Linked List**
- Linear data structure
- Linear order maintened using pointer(link)
- List contains nodes 
- Node contains 2 fields
	- Data (key or value)
	- Link (next or forw)
- There is list pointer which points to the first node of list.

- **Empty List Condition :** list = null
- **Null Pointer Derefrencing :** when we try to access null -> data , it gives error
- **Self Refrential Strcuture** : one of the member of the strcuture is refrence/pointer of self type
- **Link Assigment :** p = list -> next 
- **Traversing in Linked List** : Î˜ (n) 
 ```c
p = list

if(p!= NULL)
{
 printf("%d",p-> data);
 p = p->next;

}
```

### **Disadantages of Singly Liked List And Why We Need Other Types of Linked List**
- The link part of last node is not utilized. => solution : circular linked list
- The address of predecessor is not known. => solution : doubly linked list
- Stepping backward is not possible. => solution : doubly linked list
---
### **Doubly Linked List**
![[Pasted image 20250211153847.png]]
- we may mentain two pointer first list and last list OR only one start pointer 
```c
strcut node 
{
int data;
struct node *next;
struct node *prev;
}
```

### **Header List**
- A **header list** is a variation of a **linked list** that includes a special **header node** at the beginning. This header node does not store useful data , store meta data.
- below example header node use to store numbers of node.

- Types 
	- 1. Grounded List : last  node  link = null
	- 2. Circular List :  last node link = header list
