### **Stack**   
- A linear data strcuture in which insertion and deletion both are performed from the same end know as top of the stack
- Known as LIFO(last in first out) or FILO (first in last out)
- Operations
	- Push : insertion in stack
	- Pop : deletion in stack
	- IsEmpty : 
	- Peep(read)  : return i th element from the top , without changing stack.
	- Change (write): update  i th of the stack form the top

### **Implementation using array

- NOTE : 
	- Some implementation may use another index => Bottom (it points to no any element of stack).
	- In case of stack is empty => top = bottom (based on the previous example , bottom = -1)
	- Bottom index always be fixed , and Top index is variable

### **Multiple Stacks in Single Array**
- **Method 1 :** Proide equal halves to each stack ![[Pasted image 20250213193854.png]]
- **Method 2 :**![[Pasted image 20250213194022.png]]

### **Queue Using Stacks**

### **Application of Stack**
#### 1.Expression  Evalutaion 
- Notation : prefix (polish notation), infix  and  postfix (reverse polish notation)  
- Prefix : When operator is placed before operands , eg:  sum of a and b => +ab
- Infix : When operator is placed between operands , eg: a + b
- Postfix : When operator is placed after operands , eg: ab+ ![[Pasted image 20250214115054.png]]![[Pasted image 20250214120017.png]]![[Pasted image 20250214150655.png]]![[Pasted image 20250214224252.png]]![[Pasted image 20250214224349.png]]![[Pasted image 20250214225407.png]]![[Pasted image 20250214225938.png]]

### 2. Recursion
- When function calls itself.
- Characteristics of a good recursive function:
	- 1. It should have a base/exit/termination condition for which the function does not call itself. 
	- 2. Every time the function calls itself , the base condition should come close.
- **Types of Recursion :**
	- 1. Direct Recursion
		- Tail
		- Head
	- 2. Indirect Recursion
	- 3. Nested Recursion

- **Actiation Record**
	- Whenever a fucntion is called , a record is created and stored onto the stack.
	- Wheneer a function is completed , the activation record is removed from stack.![[Pasted image 20250215101752.png]]
- Solve recursion question with the help of recursion tree
