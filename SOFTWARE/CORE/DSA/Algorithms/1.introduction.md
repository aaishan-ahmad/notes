### **Algorithms are divided into 2 broad categories:**
- 1. Data Structure specific algorithms
- 2. General algorithms/techniques

### **Data Structure Specific Algorithms**
- **1. Arrays**
	- Sorting:
	    - QuickSort: Efficient average-case time complexity (O(`nlog n`))
	    - MergeSort: Stable sort, useful when order matters (O(`nlog n`))  
	- Searching:
	    - Binary Search: Fast search in sorted arrays (O(`log n`))    
	- Two Pointers:
	    - In-place manipulation, often for sorted arrays (e.g., removing duplicates)    
	- Sliding Window:
	    - Subarray problems, finding maximum/minimum within a window
- **2. Linked Lists**
	- Traversal:
	    - Iterate through the list, understand the node structure    
	- Insertion/Deletion:
	    - At beginning, end, or at a specific position    
	- Reversal:
	    - In-place reversal, recursive and iterative approaches    
	- Cycle Detection:
	    - Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm
-  **3. Hash Tables (Hash Maps/Sets)**
	- Implementation not needed. Just understand following:
	    - Understand how hash functions work
	    - Insertion/Deletion/Lookup
	    - Collision Handling
-  **4. Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)**
	- Traversal:
	    - Inorder, Preorder, Postorder (recursive and iterative)    
	- Searching:
	    - Find a node with a given value (especially in BSTs)
-  **5. Stacks**
	- Implementation not needed. Just understand following:
    - Push/Pop/Peek Operations
- **6. Queues**
	- Implementation not needed. Just understand following:
	    - Enqueue/Dequeue Operations
- **7. Heaps (Priority Queues)**
	- Implementation not needed. Just understand following:
	    - Insertion/Deletion (extract-min/max)
	    - Building a Heap
	- Top `K` Elements:
	    - Using a heap to find `k` largest/smallest elements
- **8. Graphs**
	- Traversal:
	    - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
	    - Depth-First Search (DFS)    
	- Shortest Path:
	    - Dijkstra's Algorithm
	- Cycle Detection:
	    - DFS
	- Minimum Spanning Trees  
 - **9. Tries**
	- Implement Trie from scratch    
	- Insertion/Searching:
	    - For words/prefixes    
	- Autocompletion:
	    - Using a trie for word suggestions
- **10. Union-Find (Disjoint Set)**
	- Implement Union-Find from scratch
	- Find/Union Operations
	- Cycle Detection in undirected graphs


### **General algorithms/techniques**
- **1. Recursion**
	- Defining a problem in terms of itself, often leading to elegant and concise solutions.
    - Solve: Factorial calculation, tree traversals, depth-first search.
- **2. Dynamic Programming**
	- Breaking down a problem into overlapping subproblems and storing solutions to avoid recomputation.
	- Solve: Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem, Longest Common Subsequence.
- **3. Greedy Algorithms**
	- Making locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum.
    - Implement: Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.
-  **4. Backtracking**
	- Incrementally building solutions, exploring all possible paths, and abandoning invalid ones.
    - Solve: Sudoku solver, N-Queens problem, generating permutations.
