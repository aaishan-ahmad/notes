### **Implementation**
A Disjoint Set can be implemented using:
- **1. Array-based representation** (Naive approach, O(n) per operation)
- **2. Optimized Union-Find** (Using **Path Compression** and **Union by Rank**, O(α(n)) per operation, where α(n) is the Inverse Ackermann function, nearly constant time).

### **Applications**
- **Graph Algorithms**:
    - **Kruskal's Algorithm** (for Minimum Spanning Tree)
    - **Connected Components** in a graph
    - **Cycle Detection** in an undirected graph
- **Network Connectivity**
- **Dynamic Connectivity Problems**
- **Image Processing** (Connected Component Labeling)
- **Percolation Theory**
