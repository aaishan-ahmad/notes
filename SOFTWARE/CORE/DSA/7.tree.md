### **Tree**
- Non-linear hirearchy data strcuture that consists of nodes connected by edges
- n nodes => n-1 edges
- Tree terminologies
	- 1. Root : 
	- 2. Child : 
	- 3. Parent : 
	- 4. Sibling :
	- 5. Subtree : 
	- 6. Internal node : node with atleast  one child 
	- 7. External node (leaf node) : node with zero child
	- 8. Level : start with 0 
- A node either be internal or external
- Total nodes = internal node + external node

### **Tree Traversal**
- 1. Preorder : nLR (node then left subtree then right subtree)
- 2. Inorder : LnR
- 3. Postorder :LRn

### **Observations form Traversals**
- First symbol of the preorder traversal is always root
- Last symbol of  the postorder traversal is alwas root

### **Converse Order Traversal**
- 1. Converse Preorder : nRL (node then right subtree then left subtree)
- 2. Converse Inorder : RnL
- 3. Converse Postorder :RLn

### **Observation for Converse Order Traversal**
- Reverse of converse preorder traversal is postorder traversals
- Reverse of converse postorder is preorder traversal
- Reverse of converse inorder traversal is inorder traversal

---
### **Construct Tree Using Traversals**
- Minimum 2 traversals required
- One should be inorder traversal for unique tree
- preorder Or postorder : To obtain root of subtree
- Inorder : Left subtree and right subtree 
- Example : ![[Pasted image 20250217220103.png]]
- Why not unique tree without inorder![[Pasted image 20250217230726.png]]

### **Complete Binary**
- A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level , except possibly the last , is completely filled , and all nodes are as far left as possible 
![[Pasted image 20250218102030.png]]
- **Strict Complete Binary Tree**
	- A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level is completely filled.

### **Full Binary Tree**
- A full binary tree (sometimes proper binary tree or 2-tree) is a tree in which every node than the leaves has two children.
- In simple word no an node haing single child (degree 1) OR either node is dgree 0 or 2

---
### **3-tree**
- Every node has either 0 or 3-children.
