### **Collision**
- A situation that occurs when two distinct keys have the same hash value(location)
- **Collision Resolution Techniques**
- Open Addressing (Closed Hashing)
	- 1. Linear Probing![[Pasted image 20250224102634.png]]
	- 2. Quadratic Probing![[Pasted image 20250224102842.png]]
	- 3. Random Probing : r is random but constant for always![[Pasted image 20250224104729.png]]![[Pasted image 20250224104907.png]]
	- 4. Double Hashing : for each key has it own random number![[Pasted image 20250224110902.png]]![[Pasted image 20250224112121.png]]
- Closed Addressing (Open Hashing)
	- 1. Chaining / Open Chaining: we don't store value in hash-table ,store in linked list ![[Pasted image 20250224112937.png]]![[Pasted image 20250224150945.png]]![[Pasted image 20250224151255.png]]

### **Clustering**
 - 1. Primary Clustering : The tend is for long sequence of preoccupied positions still become longer at one place 
 - 2. Secondary Clutering : The tend is for long sequence of preoccupied positions still become longer , primarily at diffrent places.

---
### **Load Factor**
- Average number of keys per slot![[Pasted image 20250224154540.png]]

### **Space Utilization**

### **Perfect Hashing**
- If we have n keys to be inserted and n slots are there in the table . Insert all keys in hash table without collision.
- Only possible when all keys are known.

---
### **Minimal Perfect Hashing**
- n keys but m slots in the hash table (m<n).
- No collision for first m insertion after that collision for all remaining (n-m) keys.
---
### **Uniform Hashing**
- The hash function should be able to generate all locations.![[Pasted image 20250224182238.png]] ![[Pasted image 20250224182747.png]]
