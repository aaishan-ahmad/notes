### **Process Sheduling**
- Process scheduling is a core task of an operating system (OS) that manages the execution of processes in an efficient manner. It ensures the CPU and other resources are used effectively, maximizing performance and minimizing waiting time.
- **Sheduling queues**
	- Job queue - all process which are in new state
	- Ready queue - all process which are in ready state
	- Device queue -  all process which are waiting of a specific devices

- All queue will have PCBs of processes in mm (OS). 
- **Types of Schedular**
	- **Long-term Scheduler (JOB scheduling)** : schedule/bring the processes form new state (job queue) to ready state (ready queue). means aditted operation done by long term schedular. so in case resource allocation happens.long term schedular can admit the process in two way 1. initiated by user 2. initiated by os.
	- **Short-term Scheduler (CPU scheduling)** : It select one of all ready process to run on cpu. property should in CPU sheduler/Short-term Scheduler are 1.Minimize wait time and Turn-around time, 2. Maximize CPU utilization (throughput), 3. Fairness  
	- **Mid-term Scheduler (Medium term )** : does swiping (m.m to secondar and vis-versa).  swapping aka rolling (if swapping done based on priority of processes). When a process swap-out then state of the process is suspended               ![[Pasted image 20241213185657.png]]

	-  swap out aka sleep and swap in aka wake-up

### **Sheduling Time**
- When short-term scheduler(CPU scheduler) shedule the procesess each process have some time attached to it. these below given times is attached with a process.
- **1. Arrival Time (AT) :** The time at which process arrives in the system(ready state).  
- **2. Burst Time (BT) :**  The amount of time for which process run on CPU.  
- **3. Completion Time (CT)/ Exit Time :**  The time at which process completes.
- **4. Turnaround Time (TAT) :** The amount  of time arrivle to completion. TAT = CT - AT 
- **5. Waiting Time (WT) :** WT = TAT - BT 
- **6. Response Time RT() :** Amount of time form arrival till first time process get the CPU.
- **7. Deadline(D) :** 
- **8. Sheduling length (L) :** max (CT) - min (AT)
- **9. Throughput :** no of processes excuted per unit of time (n/l). where n = no of process will execute and L is sheduling length

### **Sheduling Alogithm**
- Every process has no any I/O operation.[Assumption in all algorithm]  
- Solve the alogithm question using gantt chart.
- **1. FCFS (first come first serve)**
	- Criteria : Arrival Time .
	- Tie-breaker : if two process come same time then smaller process id first.
	- Type : non-preemptive 
	- Problem with FCFS : In FCFS If a large task arrives first, smaller tasks arriving later must wait for it to finish, causing delays for subsequent processes. means FCFS suffer form convey effect.
	- convey effect : if a large process is shedule first then it slow down system's perfomance.
	- Advantage :
		- 1. Easy to implement
		- 2. No complex logic
		- 3. No starvation
	- Disadvantage
		- 1. No option of preemption
		- 2. Convey effect makes the system slow
- **2. SJF (Shortest Job First )**
	- Criterria : Burst Time (smallest burst time process first)
	- Tie-breaker: if two process have same BT then apply FCFS on it.
	- Type : non-preemptive
	- Advantages:
		- 1. Minimum average waiting time among no-preemptive scheduling
		- 2. Better throughput in continue run.
	- Disadavntages :
		- 1. No prracticle implement because burst time is no known in adavnce
		- 2. No option of preemption
		- 3. Longer processes may suffer from starvation
- **3. SRTF (Shortest Remaning Time First)**
	- Criterria : Burst Time
	- Tie-breaker : if two process have same Bt then apply FCFS on it.
	- Type : preemptive 
	- Problem with SJF and SRTF :
		- 1.Practical implementation is not possiable (os don't know burst time). 
		- 2.Starvation (indifinite waiting ). 
		- 3.No fairness.
	- Advanteges :
		- 1. Minimum average waiting time among all schedulin algorithm.
		- 2. Better throughput in continue run.
	- Disadvantages:
		- 1. No practical implementation because burst time is no known in advance
		- 2. Longer processes may suffer from starvation
-  **4. HRRN (Highest Response Ratio Next)
	- Objective : Not only favours shorts job but decreases the WT of longer jobs.
	- Criteria : Response ratio. (Response ration = (WT + S ) / S , where S = Service/Burst Time )
	- Tie-breaker : if two have same Response ration then use Burst time.
	- Type : Non-preemptive
	- Problem With HRRN : HRRN is a good algorithm but burst time not predictable.
- **5. Priority Based Sheduling**
	- Criteria : Priority 
	- Tie-breaker : FCFS
	- Type : Can be both  Preemptive or non-preemptive
	- Priority can be two type
		- 1. Static : fixed 
		- 2. Dynamic : may increase or decrease 
	- Who set priority : OS
	-  Problem with Priority based sheduling : It also suffer from starvation . if higher priority processes keep arriving then low priority processes may wait till indefinite time.  
	- Solution of starvation: 
		- aging.
		- After a predefine time period increase priority of all waiting processes by 1.
		- this applicable only for dynamic priority system.
	- Advantages :
		- 1. Better response for real time situations.
	- Disadvantages
		- 1. Low priority processes may suffer form starvation 
-  **6. Round-Robin sheduling**
	- Criteria : AT(Arrival time) + Q (Time Quantum = max amount of time a process run ) 
	- Tie-breaker : Process ID (smallest ID first)
	- Type : Preemptive
	- Objective : Provide interactiveness , fairness 
	- Advantages :
		- 1. Fairness (All processes execute one by one , so no starvation)
		- 2. Better Interactiveness
		- 3. Burst time is not required to be known in advance 
	    -  4. Practical use 
	- Disadvantages:
		- 1. Average waiting time and turnaround time is more 
		- 2. Can degrade to FCFS

### **Multilevel Queue (MLQ) Sheduling**
- System Processes Queue (Highest priority)
- Foreground Processes Queue
- Backgound Process Queue  (Lowest Priority)
- Scheduling among queues
	- Fixed priority preemptive scheduling method .(suffer from starvation so we introduce no-2)
	- Time slicing(60% for Sys , 30% Foreround , 10% Backgound so no startvation)
- Disadvantage :
	- 1. Some processes may starve for CPU if some higher priority queues are never becoming empty.
	- 2. It is inflexible in nature.

### **Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Sheduling**
- ![[Pasted image 20241216203940.png]]
- Disadvantage  : 
	- 1. Some processes may starve for CPU if some higher priority queues never becoming empty . (Solve starvation by aging means moving a process to higher level after certain duration )
- Advantage : 
	- 1. flexible
