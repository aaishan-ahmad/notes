### **File**
- A file is a named collection of related information that is recorded on secondary storage.
- **File Attributes**
	- 1. Name
	- 2. Extension
	- 3. Size 
	- 4. Date 
	- 5. Author
	- 6. Created , Modified , Accessed
	- 7. Attributes : Read only , hidden
	- 8. Default Program
	- 9. Security Details
---
### **Folder / File Directive**
- file collection
- **File directory structure**
	- 1. Single level directory 
	- 2. Two level Structure
	- 3. Tree structure directory  (Latest one ): you can't make file in root directory , root directory only contain directories
---
### **File System**
- Module of OS which manages , controls , and organizes files and realated strcuture .
- **Types of file systems**
	- FAT32 : windows old file system
	- NTFS : windows new file system 
	- HFS+ : macos file system
	- Ext2/Ext3/Ext4 : linux file system
	- Swap : used for swap-out and swap-in
---

### **Disk**
- **optical disk : cd , dvd**
- **magnatic disk : HDD**

- **solid state storage  :  SSD (solid state drive) , memory card , usb flash drivers**

### **Disk Partitioning/Formatting**
- **1. Low Level (Physical partition/formating)**
	- creating the tracks and sectors
	- done by menufacturers
- **2. High Level (Logical partition/formaying)**
	- Creating C : , E : , F : ... drive
	- user does this using OS
	- Two Types of Logical partitions
		 - 1.Primary 
			 - used to store : OS , User file
			 - Ex: C drive 
		 - 2. Extended 
			 - used to store : User file
			 - Ex: E , F , ...

### **Disk Block**

---
### **Free Space Management**
- **1. Free List :** Liked-List of all free blocks 
![[Pasted image 20250109152946.png]]
- **2. Bitmap Method :** 
![[Pasted image 20250109153233.png]]
- **Some important points**
	- No search in free list , but in bitmap we seach for first zero
	- Free list is faster in allocation a free block
	- Free list size is variable , where as bitmap size is constant

### **File Allocation Methods**
- **1. Contigous Allocation**
![[Pasted image 20250109182639.png]].![[Pasted image 20250109182803.png]]
- **2. Linked Allocation**

- **3. Indexed Allocation**

### **Master Boot Record**
- A master boot record (MBR) is special type of boot sector at the very begning of partitioned computer mass storage devices.
- Conrtain the information regarding how and where the OS is located in the hard disk so that it can be booted in the RAM.
---
### **Unix I-node Structure**
- The node (index node) is a data strcuture in a unix -style file system that describes a file system object such as a file or a directory.
- Each inode stores the attributes and disk block locations of the object's data.
- The number of inode limits the total number of file/directories that can be stored in the file system.
- The inode contains the following information:
	- 1. Administrive information (permission, timestamps, etc).
	- 2. A number of direct blocks (typically 12) that contains to the first 12 blocks of the files.
	- 3. A single indirect pointer that point to a disk block which is turn is used as an index block, if the file is too big to indexed entirely by the direct blocks 
	- 4. A double indirect pointer that point to a disk block which is a collaction of pointers to disk blocks which are index blocks , used if the file is too big to be indexed by the direct and single indirect blocks.
	- 5. A triple indirect pointer that points to an index block of index blocks of index blocks

### **Disk Scheduling**
- Done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk
- using disk scheduling we will try to save seek time
- NOTE / REMEMBER : ![[Pasted image 20250110181938.png]]
#### Disk scheduling algorithms
- **1. FCFS (First Come First Serve)**
![[Pasted image 20250110202543.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250110203444.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250110202619.png]]
- **2. SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)**

- **3. Scan (Elevator)**
![[Pasted image 20250110205807.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250110205914.png]]
- **4. C-Scan (Circular-Scan)**
![[Pasted image 20250110210216.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250110210330.png]]
- **5. Look**
