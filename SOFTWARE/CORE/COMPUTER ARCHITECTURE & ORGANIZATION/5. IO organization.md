### **Peripheral / I-O Devices**
- Devices connected to processor externally except main memory (because cpu and memory directly connected through the three buses directly and no need i-o interface). 
- Three type of peripheral/i-o devices
	- **1. Input devices :** keyboard , mouse , camera
	- **2. output devices :** screen printer 
	- **3. storage devices :** hard disk , sd card , pen drive , cd
- CPU can't access IO directly because cpu is a purely electronic device and work on electronic signal  but all io devices are not electronic device and not generate  electronic signal . solution is  i-o interface .

- **Need of  IO interface**
	- 1. Peripherals are electromechanical or electromagnetic devices; and their manner of operation is different from the operation of the CPU and memory, which are electronic devices. So conversion of signal is required.
	- 2. The data transfer rate of peripherals is usually slow. So synchronization is required.
	- 3. Data codes and format in peripherals differ from the word format in the CPU and memory. So conversion of formats is required.
	- 4. The operating modes of peripherals are different from each other and each must be controlled so a peripheral does not disturb the operation of other peripherals.   
- **DMA Controller** :  DMA + interface 
-  **I-O processor** : DMA + interface + i-o instrcution execution. EX: graphic card

### **How I-O connected with cpu and memory** 
- There are 3 ways to connect memory and i-o with cpu through buses
### 1. Seprate buses for both 
![[Pasted image 20250127101008.png]]
	-   NOTE : i-o always need inteface , it is not direct connected . we can assume in figure that i-o interface implicitly.   
	- Disadantage : Constly 
	- Adantage : Easy to implement
### 2. Common data , address bus
![[Pasted image 20250127102948.png]]- CPU distinguish b/w memory and i-o using control signals
- Advantage : No memory wastages 
- Disadvantages : 
-  **i/o-mapped-i/o OR isolated i/o :** i/o devices have their own address   
### Common address , data and control bus
![[Pasted image 20250127105801.png]]

- EX:![[Pasted image 20250127105726.png]]
- disadvantage : wastage of memory 
- **Memory-mapped-i/o**
### Memory Mapped IO vs IO Mapped IO
- Nowdays IO Mppped IO is used

### **Series vs parallel Transfer

### **Syncronize vs Asyncronize Transfer**
![[Pasted image 20250127114140.png]]
- when two deices not synchronize means asynchronous then how data transfer happen between them , answer is interface syncronize the data transfer

---
### **Series Asyncronous Transfer**
![[Pasted image 20250127115817.png]]
- No transfer means '1' state
- '0'(start bit) detected means transmission started 
- Character bits follow start bit
- After last bit of character '1' (stop bit) will be sent
- Efficiency for the transmission time = 8/10 = 80%

---
### **Modes of Transfer**
### 1. Programmed I/O or Program controlled I/O or Polling 
- There is no any provision through which IO can inform to CPU about data transfer 
- data transfer b/w i/o and cpu if we want i/o to memory data transfer it prossible through cpu.
- IO sets its own status and waits
- CPU runs program periodically and checks the status of each device one-by-one
- If any device has its status set , then CPU performs data transfer for it.
- Disadantage : wastage of cpu time 
- **Time Required in programmed IO**
![[Pasted image 20250127143204.png]]
###  2. Interrupt Initiated I/O or Interrupt Driven I/O(currently used) 
- IO device has a provision (Interrupt signal) to inform to CPU about communication 
-  data transfer b/w i/o and cpu
![[Pasted image 20250127155348.png]]
- When CPU receives interrupt :
	- 1. It completes execution of current instrcution 
	- 2. Saves the state (PC , PSW etc.) of current process onto the stack 
	- 3. Branches to service the interrupt
	- 4. Resumes the previous process by  taking out the values  from stack 
- **Interrupt Service Routing (ISR) :** A routine of function , execution of which services the interrupt
- **Vector Address :** Address of reference of ISR
- **Interupt can be two type**
![[Pasted image 20250127155502.png]]
- **interrupt type based on cpu can accept the interrupt  or must accept** 
	- 1. Maskable : CPU can accept or reject the intrrupt
	- 2. Non-Maskable : CPU always accepts the interrupt
- **Internal vs External interrupts**
	- 1. External : I/O Devices generates the interrupt 
	- 2. Internal : Interrupt due to unexpected error during instruction execution , EX: page fault , system call
- **Time Require in Interrupt IO**
![[Pasted image 20250127175437.png]]
- **Simultaneous Interrupt** : What if 2 devices generate the interrupt simultaneously  
	- The highest priority interrupt device's interrupt should be serviced first.![[Pasted image 20250127185413.png]]
- **Daisy Chaining**
![[Pasted image 20250127183657.png]]
- VAD = Vector Address
- INTR = Interrupt Request 
- INTACK = Interrupt Acknowledgment 
- PI = Priority In , PO = Priority Outk
- Priority : Device1 > Device2 > Device3 , first PI recied by Device1 if Device1 is didn't send interrput then  PO from Device1 and goes to Device2 and so on
- In daisy chaning The above device priority decided by distence b/w device and cpu , close> far  
### 3. Direct Memory Access  (DMA) (currently used)
- Enable data transfer between I/O and memory without CPU intervention 
- data transfer b/w i/o and memory 
- Need a hardware to implement DMA Technique : DMAC (DMA Controller)
![[Pasted image 20250128112909.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250128113221.png]]
- NOTE : During DMA transfer CPU can perform only those operations which do not require system buses , means mostly CPU will be blocked for system buses.
- Because while DMA transfer CPU blocked so we not transfer entire data in one time and doesn't keep CPU bloacked for long time , we give small amount of time for dma then again cpu take control on system buses  (like round robin) . 
- **Modes of DMA Transfer** : For how much duration and when the Control of the buese should be  gien to  DMA.
	- **1. Burst Mode (old technique) :** A burst of data (1KB-2KB generally) transfered in one time before CPU takes back the control of the buses.  
	- **2.Cycle Stealing Mode :** slow I/O device takes some time to prepare a byte or word . During this time CPU keeps the control of the buses . whenever the word or byte is ready then cpu give the control of the buses to DMAC for one memory cycle. during this cycle the prepared byte or word is transfered with memory.
	- **3. Interleaving Mode :** Whenever CPU perform internal operations and does not require the buses then DMAC will be given the control of the buses. Hence CPU will never be blocked due to DMA  
	- **% Time CPU is blocked :** ![[Pasted image 20250128165611.png]]![[Pasted image 20250128165839.png]]![[Pasted image 20250128170204.png]]
