### **Architecture Vs Organization**
- **Architecture (Blue print) :** Conceptal design & fundamental operational strcuture
	- CPU design 
	- Instructions
	- Addressing modes
	- Data formate
- **Organization (implementation) :** Deals with physical devices and their interconnections with a perspective of improving the performance. 
	- I/O organization
	- Memory Organization 
	- Performance

### **Data Formate**
- Binary representation of data values
- Data
	- **Numbers**
		- Fixed point/ Integer
			- Unsigned
			- Signed/arthmetic number
				- 1. Sign Magnitude
				- 2. 1's Complemet
				- 3. 2's Complement
		- Floating point
	- **Characters**
		- ASCII 
		- EBCDIC

### **Floating Point Representation**
-  It provides larger range of numbers with limited number of bits
- ![[Pasted image 20250107174922.png]]
- Mantissa - it is signed normalized (implicit /explicit) fractional number
- Exponent - It is stored in biassed form (only unsigned value).

### **Stored Program Architecture**
- The program which processor execute should be store in a memory (RAM/main memoey).
- 1. Von-numman's Architecture
- 2. Harvard Architecture
