Processor and Instruction Set
Ex. 1 — Find out the model and make of at least 5 processors in devices around you. The devices can include desktops, laptops, cell phones, and tablet PCs.
Ex. 2 — Make a list of peripheral I/O devices for computers. Keyboards are mice are common devices. Search for uncommon devices. (HINT: joysticks, game controllers, fax machines)
Ex. 3 — What are the four properties of an instruction set? 
Ex. 4 — Design an instruction set for a simple processor that needs to perform the following operations: 1.Add two registers 2.Subtract two registers 
Ex. 5 — Design an instruction set for a simple processor that needs to perform the following operations: 1.Add two registers 2.Save a register to memory 3.Load a register from memory 4.Divide a value in a register by two 
Ex. 6 — Design an instruction set to perform the basic arithmetic operations – add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Assume that all the instructions can have just one operand. *
Ex. 7 — Consider the sbn instruction that subtracts the second operand from the first operand, and branches to the instruction specified by the label (third operand), if the result is negative. Write a small program using only the sbn instruction to compute the factorial of a positive number. * 
Ex. 8 — Write a small program using only the sbn instruction to test if a number is prime. Theoretical Aspects of an ISA* Ex. 9 — Explain the design of a modified Turing machine. Ex. 10 — Prove that the sbn instruction is Turing complete. 
Ex. 11 — Prove that a machine with memory load, store, branch, and subtract instructions is Turing complete. ** Ex. 12 — Find out other models of universal machines from the internet and compare them with Turing Machines. Practical Machine Models 
Ex. 13 — What is the difference between the Harvard architecture and Von Neumann architecture? 
Ex. 14 — What is a register machine? 
Ex. 15 — What is a stack machine? 
Ex. 16 — Write a program to compute a + b + c − d on a stack machine.
Ex. 17 — Write a program to compute a + b + (c − d) ∗ 3 on a stack machine. 
Ex. 18 — Write a program to compute (a + b/c) ∗ (c − d) + e on a stack machine. 
** Ex. 19 — Try to search the internet, and find answers to the following questions. 1.When is having a separate instruction memory more beneficial? 2.When is having a combined instruction and data memory more beneficial
