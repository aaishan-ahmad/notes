### **CPU**
- It is a brain of a computer , containing all the circurity needed to process input , store data , and output results.
- Clock Rate : How many micro-operation a cpu can perform per second .  
- **CPU Cycle time** : Time CPU takes to perform a micro-operation
![[Pasted image 20250119123412.png]]
- **CPI (Cycles Per Instruction) :** How many cycle need to complete a instruction . It can be diffrent for diffrente type of instrcution 
- **Average CPI :** Consider computing the overall CPI for a machine A for which the following perfomance measurment were recorded when executing a set of benchmark programs. Assume that the clock rate of the CPU is 200MHZ , Total no of instrcutions = 200

CPI for a processor is not constant it depend on how many no of instruction we are executing of what type.
- **Execution Time for 1 instruction :** CPI \* Cycle time = CPI / Clock rate
- **Exection Time for n instruction :** n * CPI * Cycle Time = ( n * CPI ) / Clock rate . {CPI = avg}

### **Datapath**
- Design of cpu called datapath
- Collection of functional units such as arthmetic logic units or multiplexers 
- Perform data processing operations

### **Control Unit**
- It generates control signal and send to various componets of computer. All componets operate according to these control signals.
- **Control Variable :** Name of a control signal. Ex : read , write , IN , OUT
- **Control Word :** Collection of signals generated by control unit at once
![[Pasted image 20250120170942.png]]
control unit generates control word ,in that control word the signals are send to their respective components and components operates so that a micro-operation can be performed.
- **Types of Control Unit (bases of how control unit genrate signals)** 
	- **1. Hardwired control unit **
		- Control logic is implemented with gates , flip-flops , decoders and other digital circuits.
		- Advantages : Can be optimized to produce a faster mode of opereation.
		- Disadvantages : Rearranging the wires among varou components is difficult( means updation in control logic is difficult).![[Pasted image 20250123115223.png]]![[Pasted image 20250123114803.png]]
		- Based on the table , for each signal a boolean formula (eq<sup>n</sup>) is created and then the hardwired control unit is designed based on it.
	- **2. Microprogrammed control unit**
		- Control logic is implemented with micro-programs.
		- All possible control words are stored in a memory and based on the requiremnets specific control word is fetched and send to the devices.
		- Advantages : Updating the control logic easy.
		- Disadantages : Slow than hardwired control unit .![[Pasted image 20250123135830.png]] ![[Pasted image 20250123125804.png]]

		- EXAMPL : ![[Pasted image 20250123140651.png]]![[Pasted image 20250123141801.png]]
		- There are two types of micro-programmed control unit ![[Pasted image 20250123152744.png]] ![[Pasted image 20250123152912.png]]

### **Types of CPU Design**
- **1.RISC (Reduce instruction set computer)**
	- Less number of instrcutions
	- Fixed length instructions
	- Simple instrcutions
	- Limited addressing modes
	- Easy to implment using hardwired control unit
	- One cycle per instruction
	- Register-to-Register arthmetic operation only  
	- More number of registers
	- Preferable for pipelined cpu
- **2.CISC (complex instruction set computer)**
	- More number of instruction 
	- Variable length instructions
	- Complex instruction 
	- More  & Complex addressing mode
	- Difficult to implement using hardwired control unit
	- Multiple cycles per instrcution
	- Register to memory  and memory-to-register arthmetic operations possible 
	- Less number of register

### **How to store large content**
- **1. Byte Addressable Memory (used currently):** address per byte.
	- If data stored more then one byte then the address of that data is lowest one. 
- **2. Word Addreable Memory :**  address per word (a word = 4 byte generally)

---
### **Byte Order**
- **1. Little Endian**
- **2. Big Endian**

- NOTE: no benifite or any loss to use either. both has same performance
