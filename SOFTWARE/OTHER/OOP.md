### **History of Computer**

- 3500 BC : ABACUS
- 1833 : Ananlytical Engine , theory (Charles Babbage)
- 1888 : Simple Implementation of Analytical Engine (Henry babbage)
- 1938 : Z1 (Konrad Zuse)
- Between 1930s to 1940s
	- Mathematicals were working on computational theory which leads to the development of "Lambda Calculus" and "Turing Machine"
	- The **functional and imperative programming paradigms** we use today were first explored mathmatically in the 1930s with lambda calculus and the turing machine

### **History of Object Orinted Programming**
**Why need OOP**
- Increase reuseability 
- Maintainability of source code 
- Abstraction 
**Timeline of Programming Language**
- 1949 : Assembly language
- 1957 : Fortran
- 1958 : Algol and Lisp
- 1959 : Cobol 
- 1964 : Basic
- 1967 : Simula (First Obejct Oriented Language)
- 1970 : Pascal
- 1972 : C , SQL , Smalltalk(Pure OOP)
- 1979 : C++
- 1980 : ADA

- 2009 : Go
- 2011 : Kotlin
- 2014 : Swift


### **Object Orinted Programming**
- Object oriented Programming (OOP) was conined by Alan Kay in 1967
- Alan key with few others developed smalltalk
- First programming  language widely reconized as "Object Orineted" was **SIMULA** in 1965 
- SIMULA introdues concept of classes inheritance etc
- Object oriented programming is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data(Object) , rather than functions and logic
