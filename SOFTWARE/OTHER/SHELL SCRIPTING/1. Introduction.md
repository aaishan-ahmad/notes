## What is Shell
 - In shell scripting, A **shell** refers to a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for interacting with the operating system. It allows users to execute commands, run programs, and manage files. The shell processes the input commands and executes them either directly or by invoking the appropriate programs.
 - There are various types of shells, each with its own scripting language and features. Some popular ones include:
     - **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)**: The most widely used shell in Linux and Unix systems. It is an extension of the original Bourne shell (sh).
	- **Sh (Bourne Shell)**: One of the earliest shells, known for its simplicity and portability.
	- **Zsh (Z Shell)**: Offers additional features like better tab completion, spell-checking, and syntax highlighting.
	- **Ksh (Korn Shell)**: Combines features from the C shell (csh) and Bourne shell, with scripting capabilities.
