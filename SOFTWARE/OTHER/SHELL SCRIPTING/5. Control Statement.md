### Conditional statements
 **interger comparison **
- \-eq  -> is equal to - `if [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]`
- \-ne  -> is not equal to - `if [ "$a" -ne "$b" ]`
- \-gt  -> is greater than - `if [ "$a" -gt "$b" ]`
- \-ge  -> is greater than or equal to - `if [ "$a" -ge "$b" ]`
- -lt    -> is less than - `if [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]`
- -le   -> is less than or equal to - `if [ "$a" -le "$b" ]`
-  <=  -> is less than or equal to - `(( "$a" <= "$b" ))`
-  >    -> is greater than - `(( "$a" > "$b" ))`
-  >=  -> is greater than or equal to - `(( "$a" >= "$b" ))`

**String Comparison**
- =    -> is equal to - `if [ "$a" = "$b" ]`
- ==  -> is equal to - `if [ "$a" == "$b" ]`
- !=   -> is not equal to - `if [ "$a" != "$b" ]`
- <    -> is less than, in ASCII alphabetical order - `if [[ "$a" < "$b" ]]`
- \>    -> is greater than, in ASCII alphabetical order - `if [[ "$a" > "$b" ]]`
- -z   -> string is null, that is, has zero length

 **IF Statement Syntax**
```bash
a=1
if [ $a -eq 1 ]
then
#statement if condition is true
fi
```

**IF-else Statement Syntax**
```bash
if [condition]
#statement if condition is true
else
#statement if condition is false
fi # close the if-else statemnet
```
``
**IF-else Ladder Statement Syntax**
```bash
if [condition]
#statement if condition is true
elif [condition]
then
#statement elseif condition istrue
else
#statement if condition is false
fi # close the if-else statemnet
```

**ternary  condition**
[ condition ] && true_stetament || false_statement

**Case Statement**
```bash
case expression in
    pattern1)
        # commands if pattern1 matches
        ;;
    pattern2)
        # commands if pattern2 matches
        ;;
    *)
        # commands if no patterns match (default case)
        ;;
esac

```
- Matching Multiple Patterns
```bash
read -p "Enter a letter (y/n/q): " input
case $input in
    [yY]|[yY][eE][sS])
        echo "You entered Yes."
        ;;
    [nN]|[nN][oO])
        echo "You entered No."
        ;;
    [qQ])
        echo "Quitting..."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Invalid input, please enter y, n, or q."
        ;;
esac

```
- File Type Checking
```bash

read -p "Enter a filename: " filename

if [ ! -e "$filename" ]; then
    echo "File does not exist."
    exit 1
fi

case $filename in
    *.txt)
        echo "$filename is a text file."
        ;;
    *.jpg|*.png)
        echo "$filename is an image file."
        ;;
    *.sh)
        echo "$filename is a shell script."
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Unknown file type."
        ;;
esac
```


### Loop
**1. while loop**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
counter=1
while [ $counter -le 5 ]
do
    echo "Counter: $counter"
    ((counter++))  # Increment the counter
done
```
**2. Until loop**
loop run unit condition false 
```bash
until [ condition ]
do
#commands
done
```
**3. For loop**
Using C-style Syntax
```bash
for ((i=1; i<=5; i++))
do
    echo "Number $i"
done
```
OR, Looping Through Files
```bash
for file in \*.txt
do
    echo "Found file: $file"
done
```
OR, Iterating Over a Range of Numbers
```bash
for i in {1..5}
do
    echo "Number $i"
done
```
OR, Using "seq" for More Complex Ranges
```bash
for i in $(seq 1 2 10)
do
    echo "Number $i"
done
```
OR, Iterating Over a List of Items
```bash
for item in item1 item2 item3; do
    echo "Processing $item"
done
```
**4. Select loop**
for menu 
```bash
select opt in opt1 opt2 opt3
do
echo "you selected $opt"
done
```

*Note : we can use 'break' and 'continue' for break and skip*
